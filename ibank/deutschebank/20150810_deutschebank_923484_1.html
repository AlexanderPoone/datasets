<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Banks in Shanghai increased 2nd home down pay me nt ratio to 70%</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Banks in Shanghai increased the downpayment ratio for 2nd home mortgages According to Rong360.com, the online financing information provider, eight banks in Shanghai have adjusted up the downpayment ratio requirement on second home mortgages to 70%, with interest rate at 1.1x PBOC benchmark rate. Previously, a bank was offering 30% downpayment ratio for second home mortgages while the many others were offering 40% downpayment ratio. Currently, the number of banks offering 40% downpayment ratio for second home mortgage has decreased from 8 to 6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Experts commented the actions would help stabling the prices</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The media (CFI) reported this may be attributable to the recent strong performance of the property market. In July, secondary home sales in Shanghai reached record high of 34,941 units while transaction volume in primary market was 1.35msqm, the first in the past 6 years that sales volume in July exceeded 1 msqm. Mr. Yan Yuejin, expert from E-House commented that tightening mortgage requirement could help to curb the prices and hence would continue to support the end-user and first time purchase demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides, Ms. Chen Lina, another expert from Sinyi Property Agents commented that that increase in downpayment ratio would increase the entry barrier to the secondary market and would push the potential buyers to speed up to take action. Hence the transactions would be boosted shortly before all the banks apply the same policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further loosening unlikely for first home mortgages</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The strong property market in Shanghai has resulted in the strong demand for mortgages. Banks in the city have been allocating adequate liquidity for first home mortgages, with many of them are offering over 10% discount on the interest rate. Rong360.com expected that the policies on first home mortgages are unlikely to be further loosened but that for second home mortgages will be tightened and would help to prevent the over-heated market.</span></p>
