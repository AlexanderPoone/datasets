<p><span class="font1">US Credit Strategy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Scenario Analysis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we outlined in our </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">2024 Outlook</span><span class="font2">, this year is about discerning what landing the US economy is headed for.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft landing would be the best case, with renewed disinflation toward 2%, Fed rate cuts roughly in line with market pricing, a drop in rate volatility to early 2022 levels, and stable growth without compromising profit margins.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A no-landing scenario would be similar to the current macroeconomic backdrop, but with inflation stalling in the high 2%/low 3% range. The Fed either delays cuts or cuts much less than expected, and so rate vol remains elevated. Highly leveraged issuers would be underpressure as real growth would remain under at/trend.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lastly, in a hard landing we expect the long lags of monetary policy to cause distress in higherlevered portionsof the economy with high variable debt burdens, thereby driving a retrenchment in capex &amp;&nbsp;employment. R isk assets would sell off and elevated rate volatility exacerbate credit weakness. This remains our basecase with global spreads reaching our peak &quot;hard landing&quot; targets i n Q3’24. Our second most likely scenario is a &quot;no landing&quot;.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Breaking the scenarios above into three main factors (rate volatility, funding costs, and growth), we illustrate below how the various scenarios can impact the USD supply picture in 2024. Typically, issuance increases in highergrowth environments as capital expenditure increase, whereas high rate volatility and higher funding costs are negatively correlated with supply, particularly in the HY-space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In both a &quot;No&quot; and &quot;Hard&quot; landing we would expect issuance to fall below longterm averages as higher yields and elevated rate volatility would keep discretionary borrowing limited. A hard landing would be worsethan a no-landing as $IG supply is likely relatively similar, but HY issuance would likely dry up similar towhat was seen in late-'22 as there would be a period where funding markets freeze as we have seen in previous downturns. If a soft landing becomes more likely, $HY issuers who have the ability may wait until even more rate cuts filter through the economy or market pricing before issuing, thereby pushing some issuance to next year. $IG-rated corporates would see the benefit sooner, as a true soft landing could come with lower long-end rates. Overall, a soft landing would be quite positive for 2024 supply, and take gross supply back closer to 2023 levels. The greater growth forecast would increase corporate capex investment and the low rate vol would create an attractive lending atmosphere.</span></p>
