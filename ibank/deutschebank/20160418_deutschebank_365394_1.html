<h2><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Bl's modification of monetary operations is a positive step</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Having cut the policy rate by 75bps while inflation remains low and stable, and investors favorable predisposed toward Indonesia, Bl feels confident to move ahead with a range market deepening measures. For a while the central bank has been uncomfortable with the growing disconnect between the overnight borrowing rate and the policy rate, with the former settling at levels much lower than the guidance the authorities intend to provide. The short end of the market has also been subject to frequent episodes of high volatility. While the system is in overall liquidity surplus, it is also fragmented and dysfunctional, with surplus banks not lending to deficit banks. Furthermore, the Bl rate has so far reflected the equivalent of 12-month interbank rates, although functionally such a market barely exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">¡Bi wants to breach the gap between the policy rate and overnight rate</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font2">The goal therefore is to target a much shorter duration (7-day repo) and, by extension, a lower policy rate (5.5% for 7-day vs. 6.75% for 12-month). A 75bps corridor has been established around that, with a deposit facility offering 4.75% and a standing lending facility charging 6.25%. The expectation is that this framework will encourage banks to develop longer-duration rates of intermediation, adding liquidity and depth to the term structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While Bl insists that this move will leave the policy stance unchanged, the fact of the matter is that as the policy is implemented, banks' cost of funding will effectively decline. At the same time, we believe that monetary operation to achieve the targeted rates window could cause the overnight rate (JIBOR), currently below 5%, to rise toward the policy rate of 5.5%. The net impact of the new framework is therefore unclear from the perspective of policy stance, and will depend on the reaction of the market and the success of Bl's policy instruments. It should nonetheless lead to more market-based pricing along the term structure, and could encourage banks to engage in I DR swaps, which we would welcome.</span></p>
