<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Redemption of 4.875% 2015 and 6.6 25% 20 20c15</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">Bond redemption</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a SGX release this morning, Noble announced that it has fully redeemed the 4.875% 2015 senior notes (USD500mm) on their scheduled maturity (5 August 2015). Noble has also redeemed the entire principal amount outstanding of its 6.625% 2020 senior notes (USD235mm) callable on 5 August 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What's left along the NOBLSP USD curve?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The redemption of the 6.625% 2020 and 4.875% 2015 bonds effectively removes about 27% of Noble’s investible bonds in the USD space. We are now left with the 6.75% 2020 senior notes (US$1208mm), the 3.625% 2018 senior notes (US$400mm) and the 6% perpetual bond (US$400m).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Liquidity position</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Noble earlier said that it will still have readily available cash of well over USD1 bn after the bond redemption. At the end of July, the company also had around USD15bn in bank lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upcoming events to watch</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Noble has brought forward its Q2 2015 earnings announcement date to 10 August 2015. The findings of the PwC independent assurance report will also be released on the same day. Noble is expected to provide additional disclosures around Yancoal valuation and on its inventory sales as part of its results announcement. An analyst conference call and webcast will be held starting 1900 HKT/SGT on the 10 August (Dial in details for the conference call below). Following the earnings release, Noble will also hold an Investor Day in Singapore (date TBD). Per the company, there will be no restrictions on third party attendance nor on questions within the time available at the Investor Day event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We will monitor its Q2 results (particularly cash flow performance), findings of the PwC report, and any updates regarding the ''potential financings, and strategic and/or investment options&quot; as flagged by the company few days ago.</span></p>
