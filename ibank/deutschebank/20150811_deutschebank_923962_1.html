<p><span class="font2">Growth deceleration observed in four hospitals within PHG group</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We highlight that four out of five major hospitals of Phoenix experienced growth deceleration in 1H15. Jian Gong Hospital delivered 5% YoY growth in 1H15, vs. 15%, 17% and 29% in 2014, 2013 and 2012 respectively. For Yan Hua Hospital, growth in 1H15 was 9% vs. 11%, 15%, and 18% in 2014, 2013, and 2012 respectively. Mentougou Hospital exhibited growth of 10% vs. 15%/20%/56% in 2014/2013/2012. For Mentougou TCM Hospital, growth was 13% in 1H15, compared with 28%/29%/2% in 2014/2013/2012, respectively. Jing Mei Hospital was the only one with growth acceleration with 18% growth in 1H15, compared with 10%/21%/18% in 2014/2013/2012.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tier 2 hospitals anchor sector growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Most of the hospitals under PHG group are tier 2 hospitals, which is a good indicator for sector growth as tier 1 (class 3) hospitals are likely to undergrow tier 2 hospitals, whose growth rates are lower than those of tier 3 hospitals. While one could argue the growth of hospital revenue in Beijing is likely to be slower vs. tier 2 cities, we believe sequential comparison is still meaningful. From our last hospital tour, we learned that the budget growth rates for Mentougou TCM hospital and Jing Mei hospital are no more than 10% in 2015. We await high frequency data for June to confirm the growth trend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other take-aways</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also highlight other interesting comments offered by the management of PHG. Management indicated that the growth rate at tier 2 hospitals in Beijing was 3% in 1H15 while tier 1 hospitals in Beijing achieved 8% growth in 1H15, compared with 10-13% in 2014. The higher growth of tier 1 hospitals vs. tier 2 hospitals in 1H15 was different from the historical industry pattern, which was ascribed to the higher concentration of patients in tier 1 hospitals in Beijing. However management did not offer any explanation on the weak growth of 3% for tier 2 hospitals. We continue to believe the growth slowdown in the sector was mainly caused by the GDP growth slowdown, reimbursement budgeting, the ongoing anti-bribery campaign, as well as lower hospital revenue contributions from drug sales.</span></p>
