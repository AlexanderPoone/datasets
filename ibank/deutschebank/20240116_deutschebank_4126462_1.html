<p><span class="font1">Taiwan concluded its latest round of elections over the weekend, with MrLaiChing-e of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) winning the Presidency with 40.1% of all votes (5.6m, </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 1</span><span class="font1">), beating the KMT's Mr Hou You-ih (33.5%; 4.7m) and the TPP's M r Ko Wen-je (26.5%; 3.7m). The margin of victory for Mr.Lai was better than in the last opinion </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">poll</span><span class="font1">, though narrower than that for outgoing President Tsai in 2020. This is the first time since Taiwan began holding direct Presidential elections in 1996 that any party has held power beyond two four-year terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Noneofthethree parties contesting the elect ions forthe Legislative Yuan managed to secure an absolute majority (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 2</span><span class="font1">). It is the first time in 20 years that the President's party has failed tosecurean absolute majority in the legislature, and the first time that a third party- TPP with 8 seats - gets the balance vote. Following the results, the new President-in-waiting has </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">talked about</span><span class="font1"> &quot;the need to work across party lines, calling for communication, consultation, participation, and cooperation, under a new structure of the legislature.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new Legislative Yuan will begin its session on February 1<sup>st</sup> with the election of a new House Speaker and Deputy House Speaker, while the new President will be inaugurated on 20<sup>th</sup> May.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Implications for cross-strait relations</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The election result should not, in and of itself, move the needle in any material fashion on the market's perception of cross-strait relations. The initial response from key stakeholders has been well contained.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The President elect has argued for maintaining the status quo on crossstrait relations. In his victory </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">statement</span><span class="font1">, he appealed to China to find ways to communicate and lower tensions. As long as the &quot;two sides could face each other in dignity and parity&quot;, Mr.Lai said he hoped to &quot;replace confrontation with dialogue and confidently pursue exchanges with China.&quot; He also avoided mentioning President Tsai's 'four commitments' framework for cross-strait relations.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beijing's initial </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">response</span><span class="font1"> has also been relatively muted, with no direct criticism of the new President-elect. In his initial comments post the elections, US President Biden has </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">stated</span><span class="font1"> that the US does not support independence for Taiwan, while reaffirming the one-China policy.</span></p></li>
