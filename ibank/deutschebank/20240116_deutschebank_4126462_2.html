<p><span class="font1">simple majority in the legislative council. Passing bills - including, for example, the US-Taiwan Initiative on 21 st CenturyTrade and US arms sales to Taiwan - will be contingent to more active negotiations with the opposition. </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Political experts</span><span class="font1"> have suggested this would also reduce the risk of thegovernment introducing any &quot;keyactionstochange Taiwan's status, such as a constitutional revision ora referendum&quot; given this needs a super majority, which the DPP does not have.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is plenty of water to still potential flow under this bridge, however. The three things markets would be watching for on cross-strait risks in the near term would be; (a) any major military exercises carried out by China ahead of the Presidential inauguration; (b) China's response to the US delegation led by ex-National Security Advisor Stephen Hadley and former Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg, who arrived on Sunday in Taiwan for a </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">three-day visit;</span><span class="font1"> and (c) whether US House Speaker Mike Johnson will dispatch a delegation from the relevant House Committees (including himself) to Taiwan post the May inauguration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Implications for domestic economic policy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the domestic side, the key watch point ahead will be the beginning of the new Legislative Yuan session, and where the new House Speaker and Deputy House Speaker will be elected. The dynamics there would indicate whether KMT and TPP are looking to convert their pre-poll understanding intoa more formal coalition. TPP leader Mr Ko has thus far</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">said</span><span class="font1">that &quot;in order to play the roleof a critical minority, the TPP will not work with a fixed side. We will cooperate with whoever is right.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What are likely to be the priorities of the Lai administration?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reducing economic reliance on China. Since the pandemic and the introduction of US export controls on semiconductors to China, Taiwan exports to China have been on the decline - dropping from a peak of 30% in 2020 to 22% in 2023 (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Fig ure </span><span class="font1">3). This is mainly due to the reduction of machinery exports (in which electronic exports make up a sizable portion) to China, which make up -70% of Taiwan's exports to China (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 4</span><span class="font1">). Indeed, electronic exports to China (as a % of total machinery exports by Taiwan) have declined from 31% in 2020 to 23% in 2023 (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 5)</span><span class="font1">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is likely that this number will continue to fall, not just due to the tightening of US export controls on China, but also due to: (a) the ongoing diversification in electronics supply chains away from China towards countries like Vietnam and India; and (b) Taiwan's desire to reduce its economic reliance on China, particularly with China trying to limit Taiwan's exports to the Mainland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chinese authorities recently announced they would </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">suspend</span><span class="font1"> tariff concessions on 12 types of petrochemical products from Taiwan. These products had enjoyed zero tariffs since 2013 as part of the so-called &quot;Early-Harvest&quot; list under the Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed in June 2010 between Taiwan and mainland China. According to China, more restrictions could be </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">forthcoming</span><span class="font1">. These include exports of agricultural, fishery, machinery, auto parts and textile products. Although for now these measures should have a limited impact on Taiwan's exports, since most of these products make up only a small part of Taiwan'sexportstoChina, the Taiwanese authorities will still likely take preemptive steps to reduce their dependence on the Chinese market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Corporates have also been actively repositioning their investments. For example,</span></p>
