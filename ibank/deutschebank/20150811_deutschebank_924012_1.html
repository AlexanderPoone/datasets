<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark4"></a>SOE reform on track, but merger is invisible in the near term</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Market sentiment heats up as a result of an old theme - merger expectations Share prices of constructors (CRG, CRCC and CCC) rose more than 5% yesterday, mainly due to the following: 1) the expectation of more SOE mergers following progress on the potential merger of China Shipping Group and COSCO Group; and 2) the newly approved SOE reform blueprint to change the way SOEs are supervised and financed (i.e. to set up 'Temasek-like' asset management companies and render SOEs more flexibility in making operational decisions). We believe more SOE reforms are likely for constructors, while the possibility of CRG and CROC's merger is still low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The merger of CRG and CRCC in the short to medium term is invisible Compared with the CSR/CNR merger, we still believe that the merger possibility of CRG and CRCC is low due to the following: 1) CRG and CROC's overseas competition was less fierce than that of CNR and CSR in the past years - one of the key drivers behind the CNR/CSR merger; 2) constructors have lower needs for cutting-edge technology localization and integration compared to rolling stock players; 3) less synergy could be realized from nonrailway and non-subway businesses; and 4) coordination between the two could be improved with recent senior management rotation in the railway sector, making a merger less necessary. We also believe that there is a low possibility of CCC being involved in any mergers. However, a merger possibility is not completely excluded in the longer term if it is required by the government.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Other SOE reforms are on track</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 2014, CRG and CRCC finished internal reorganization and integration in order to improve operational efficiency. YTD spin-offs of CROC's railway track maintenance machinery and CCC's dredging business have been progressing smoothly. Both spin-off companies have submitted IPO application proof and are expected to be listed on the HKEx in 2H15. Meanwhile, CCC's first batch of preferred stock issuance is likely to be finished in the near term. Mixed ownership, equity incentives, and the new role of asset management for their parent companies are also among potential reform plans, in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">New order pick-up should be a key share price driver in 2H15; Buy CCC/CRCC We believe the merger possibility is low, but this news could boost the sector in the short term. Going forward, potential new order pick-up may further support constructors' share price over the rest of 2015, in our view. Based on our checks with constructors, new orders of rail projects have bottomed out since June. CRG and CRCC's new orders of non-railway projects slightly recovered in July. Continued policy easing and upcoming detailed local OBOR plans could also improve market sentiment. CCC is our preferred stock among China constructors, given its: 1) inexpensive valuation and 2) good execution and risk management. CCC's dredging business spin-off may further benefit its share price in 4Q15. We prefer CRCC to CRG mainly due to the former's cheaper valuation.</span></p>
