<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What's New on healthcare policies</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Three pieces of policy-related news released recently</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We summarize the recent policy-related news in this note. According to NHFPC, public hospitals reform is marching forward as pilot reform has been implemented in 74.9% of all counties and 61% of the 100 cities under the pilot healthcare reform program. Additionally, the government is expanding medical insurance coverage for severe diseases, which is positive for drug manufacturers targeting these diseases such as cancer, including Fudan Zhangjiang (1349.HK), Sino Biopharm (117 7.HK) and CSPC (1093.HK). Lastly, the street widely expected a policy lift to allow prescription drugs to be distributed online. However it is likely this would be delayed indefinitely. We continue to expect volatility for drug names as policy risks are likely to materialize in the near term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Updates on public hospitals reform</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to NHFPC, 4,061 public hospitals in China have started reform measures. In particular, we highlight that reform has begun in 1,463 counties and 3,297 county-level hospitals, representing 74.9% and 78.3% of total respectively. Additionally, the scope of healthcare reform in pilot cities was expanded to 100 cities. 61 cities, including 764 hospitals, have kicked off the reform. On reducing drug sales contribution to hospitals revenue, 3,077 county-level and 446 city-level hospitals removed the 15% mark-up. Moreover, 21 provinces raised service fees to compensate the loss from drug sales. NHFPC also indicated that drug tender is likely to be accelerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Expansion of medical insurance coverage for major illnesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On August 2, the State Council released the document No.57 which targeted at broader coverage of severe diseases. Specifically, the government aims to cover all citizens under UBMI/NRCMI by 2015, with over 50% reimbursement rate which would be funded by both programs. Importantly, commercial insurance programs are encouraged to cover the severe diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further delay for online prescription drug distribution</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On August 1, China Business Journal reported that China might halt the policy release to allow online prescription drug distribution. The policy was first expected to be released in late 2014 and has been delayed. The major concern for the authorities is potential emergence of fake drugs online. As a reminder, the market size of online drug distribution reached RMB7.8bn in 2014 with a CAGR of 167% from 2010 to 2014. In 2014, online drug distribution accounted for only 2.4% of the retail drug market vs. 30.0% in the US.</span></p>
