<p><span class="font1">June labor survey results show total cash earnings fell a sharp 2.4% YoY. This was due to a steep decline in special cash earnings, so should be probably looked at in average with Jul-Aug. Scheduled wages grew 0.4% YoY indicating a continued uptrend in nominal wages, even though the figure could be revised down in the final report. The number of regular employees rose 2.1%; combined with wages this brings aggregate employee income growth to 2-3%. Full-time employee numbers rose 1.5%, not greatly different to growth of 3.4% for part-timers, which we see as a positive.. Details on page 10</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">This morning's ADP private employment survey will anchor market expectations for Friday's nonfarm payroll report. Our forecast for the former is roughly in line with the 12-month trailing average of the series. While ADP tends to be one of the better predictors of the monthly change in private nonfarm payrolls, it is far from perfect. Case in point, over the past two years, the median absolute difference between the initial ADP print and private payrolls has been a little less than 40k. Hence, it would take a sizeable downside miss on ADP for us to revise our payroll forecast. The hurdle may be even higher if the employment component of the nonmanufacturing ISM survey moves back toward the higher end of its post-recession range. Details on page 11</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Yoji Otani</span><span class="font1">: Bubbles always come in different forms. With the big cliff of April 2017 in sight, enjoy the last party like a driver careening to the cliff's brink. Japan is now painted in a completely optimistic light, with the pessimism which permeated Japan after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011 forgotten and expectations for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics riding high. The bank lending balance to the real estate sector is at a record high, and we expect bubblelike conditions in the real estate market to heighten due to increased investment in real estate to save on inheritance taxes. History repeats itself, but always in a slightly different form. We have no choice but to dance while the dance music continues to play. Details on page 12</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Abhishek Saraf:</span><span class="font1"> Earnings revisions turn neutral in July'15. For the first time in the current calendar year, the earnings revision ratio for DB coverage has turned neutral, with DB analysts raising FY16/FY17 earnings for 23/25 companies and cutting FY16/FY17 earnings for 26/24 companies. Until now cuts had far exceeded raises as Dec’14 and Mar'15 earnings had been largely disappointing. In addition, July'15 witnessed the first instance of positive Sensex EPS revisions in 2015, with DB est for FY16/FY17 Sensex EPS raised by 0.3%/0.1%. This is in line with our thesis that the worst of earnings cuts may be over as (i) several macro indicators are showing improvement, (ii) the government has started to spend, and (iii) earnings have already been cut sharply since the start of the year. In July'15, oil companies witnessed the largest earnings raises, with HPCL/BPCL EPS raised 10%-12%. Other key stocks to see meaningful EPS raises were Bharti (10%/7%for FY16/17), TCS (6%/1%), RIL (4%/2%), Coal India (3%/4%) and Infosys (3%/3%), among others. Details on page 13</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">Yu Yoshida:</span><span class="font1"> Buy to Hold , tgt JPY860 to JPY590. Return to the maze; time needed for normalization. We lower our rating on Toshiba Tec from Buy to Hold and lower our target price from ¥860 to ¥590. Several unpalatable factors emerging from operations during the integration process with TGCS resulted in consolidated operating losses in 1Q. Furthermore, the postponement of the final payment to IBM and the appointment of a new TGCS president with a background in printing business suggest that the company is lost in a maze once again. We lower our investment rating on the assumption that more time will be needed to return to normal operations. Details on page 14</span></p>
