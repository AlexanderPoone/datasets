<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Source: Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg Finance LP</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">__________________________________________________ </span><span class="font2">Commentary for Tuesday: Last Friday's employment report bolsters the case for a Fed rate hike at next month's FOMC meeting (September 17). However, there are a lot of data between now and then, not the least of which is the August employment report, which is due on September 4. Soon, forecasters will be putting ''pen to paper&quot; their August estimate of nonfarm payrolls. If history repeats, they are likely to be too high.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As we also discussed in the </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">US Economics Weekly</span><span class="font2">, there has been a tendency for August employment to surprise the consensus to the downside. The last four August employment reports were all weaker than expected: they were on average 55k below consensus. Obviously, this is a small sample, but the data are even more compelling if we go back further in time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since 1988, when our sample begins, August nonfarm payrolls have disappointed the financial markets in 21 out of 27 years, which is 78% of the time. The average forecast error has been -61 k. The range of misses, though, has been large. The median forecast error has been -42k. In 1992, the consensus over-predicted August nonfarm payrolls by a whopping 233k, and there was an extremely large miss the following year (189k). However, there were a handful of more recent years in which the over-estimation was relatively small, such as 2004 (-6k), 2008 (-11 k) and 2013 (-8k).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The years in which August surprised the financial markets to the upside are also telling, because the forecast misses were relatively small. At the margin, this would also cause us to look for a soft figure, at least relative to consensus expectations. In point of fact, in the six years that August nonfarm payrolls surprised to the upside, the average upward surprise was a modest 30k, due mostly a 72k under-prediction in 1995. The upward surprises in 2002 (9k), 2006 (3k) and 2009 (9k) were each so small that they are somewhat irrelevant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Where are August nonfarm payrolls likely to print? It is still too soon for the consensus estimate, but it will probably be close to the average year-to-date monthly gain of 211k. If we conservatively use the median error, rather than the average forecast error, we are looking at August nonfarm payrolls of 170k. By itself, this number should be strong enough to keep the Fed on track for September liftoff, as job growth even at this reduced pace would still be consistent with falling unemployment. As we wrote last week, we only need job gains of around 100k to keep the unemployment rate from rising, so anything faster will put downward pressure on the rate. Of course, August nonfarm payrolls could be significantly weaker than our 170k estimate. Still, we would fade the softness, especially considering the fact many of these August disappointments were ultimately revised away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Admittedly, there is no good reason why August tends to surprise to the downside. We do know that there are always soft patches in hiring during the year. See &quot;Even in best of times, labor market experiences periodic soft patches&quot; </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">US Daily Economic Notes</span><span class="font2">, March 25, 2015. For whatever reason, August tends to be one of the months this occurs. We hope the Fed will not use this as an excuse to delay liftoff, especially if other key labor data such as jobless claims remain at levels consistent with 200k-plus job growth over time.</span></p>
