<p><span class="font4">US GSIB score update: 2023 Q3</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We provide an update on the 2023 03 Systemic Risk Report (FR Y-15) for US GSIBs. The systemic risk score determines the capital surcharge for a GSIB one full calendar year later. Only the year-end score is used, but intra-year score estimates offer potentially useful information on GSIB behaviors into the year-end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the end of 03, all GSIB banks except BNY had higher scores compared to yearend 2022. JPM had the largest increase (+86 points), followed by GS (+75 points); STT had the smallest increase (+3 points).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The higher scores, if unchanged, will push up JPM's capital surcharge from 4.5% to 5.0% in 2025, unless the bank can lower its score by 14 points or more in the current quarter. Similarly, GS needs to lower its score by at least 45 points in Q4 to prevent its 2025 surcharge rise from 3% to 3.5%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Citi and Bof A were operating in their respective 2022 surcharge bucket as of Q3. However, both their scores were teetering on the threshold of the next higher bucket by a few points. M S was the only large dealer bank with a comfortable buffer from the higher bucket as of Q3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Source : FR Y- tS fHings. Deutsche Bank calculations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Large dealer banks tend to aggressively shrink their market-making activity during Q4 to lower their GSIB scores for the official surcharge calculation. Last year, JPM reduced its Q4 score by 25 points, and GS reduced its by 61 points. This suggests propensity for both banks to make the necessary adjustments in the current quarter to get back into their same respective score buckets as 2022 and prevent a potential surcharge increase for 2025.</span></p>
