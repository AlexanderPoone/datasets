<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Alliances with Tmall: part of a positive trend for selected brands</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Tmall to deepen cooperation with apparel brands</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">T-mall announced today that it has signed strategic alliances with over 160 apparel brands from over 100 companies worldwide. According to a news report in the Nanfang Metropolis Daily (dated 2015 Aug 6), adidas, Anta, Li Ning and Xtep are among the brands that established cooperation with T-mall. The alliances aim to create synergy between the brands and the e-commerce platform through resources sharing on brand marketing, new &amp;&nbsp;excusive product, big data analysis...etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Further collaboration between brands and e-commerce platforms, a structural positive for selected discretionary names</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We view the news as a positive sign to the discretionary space. Recently, we have started to see e-commerce platforms' efforts to achieve deeper cooperation with brands while eliminating fake products. This represents a structural positive for the brands' operating environment, which suffered from fake product and irrational pricing tremendously in the past years. Despite the improving industry backdrop, the success of each brand will increasingly rely on their respective brand equity and channel management capabilities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Anta: a winner in the new era thanks to strong fundamentals</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe Anta will be one of the major beneficiaries from the e-commerce proliferation. The company has very clear brand positioning for Anta, Anta Kids and Fila. Targeting distinctly different customers vs. the international players in China, Anta is able to leverage its competitive edge (fast product cycle time, cost benefits) to excel in its unique segment. We believe e-commerce will help Anta further broaden its reach and further penetrate into its client base.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">e-commerce represents mid-single-digit of Anta's sales and has been growing at a rate of 50% YoY in 2014. Anta mainly leverages Tmall (over 50% of its e-commerce sales) and JD (30-40%). To prevent competition between e-commerce and physical channels, the company offers some exclusive products to e-commerce. We note one of Anta's key strengths is its ability to offer a good wholesale discount, which will also help ease the impact of interchannel competition, in our view. Anta holds a target to grow e-commerce to 20% of its sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Li Ning: more uncertainties</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We sense a lack of clear brand and price positioning for Li Ning in the past, which the management team is changing. While the macro tailwind will help its brand revamp process, it is still in the middle of revamping the brand, and reformatting the store network and store size. We praise the company for its smart shoe initiative with Xiaomi, and we may need more track record to confirm its potential in e-commerce. Again, the sooner Li Ning can confirm a new CEO, the least the interruption.</span></p>
