<p><span class="font2">Gross margin likely to see further compression; net gearing to rise further We anticipate the upcoming interim result announcements for Chinese developers to be rather soft in general, with gross margins likely to see further compression. On the other hand, we expect net gearing for many developers to rise, despite the low level of land acquisitions in 1H15. Meanwhile, while we have already seen three companies (Franshion, Joy City and Beijing Capital Land) issue profit warnings, we believe these are exceptional cases on uneven revenue bookings. In our view, while the soft results could dampen market sentiment, this provides a good entry opportunity for state-owned developers like COLI, CR Land, Greentown, Joy City and Franshion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Gross margin expected to see further compression in 1H15</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While gross margin has already seen a marked compression of 2 percentage points in FY14 to 31%, we believe gross margins are likely to be further compressed in 1H15. In particular, the decline in profitability will be driven by: 1) bookings of sales achieved during the market downturn in the first three quarters of 2014 at low ASPs carrying lower margins; 2) bookings of projects acquired at the land market peak in 2013; and 3) stepped-up effort to clear inventory via marked price cuts in 1H15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Net gearing is likely to rise further by mid-15 on tighter collateral requirements While most developers have slowed down their pace of acquisitions in 1H15, net gearing for many developers is likely to rise by end-2015 on the back of the tighter collateral requirements. Specifically, developers could previously deploy project loans pledged by later phases of a project for other purposes (like buying another piece of new land). However, starting this year, the entire loan from project financing for all the phases has to stay inside the project and cannot be used outside of the project. As project financings normally last for one year and have to be rolled over every year, developers that have deployed the project financing from a project to other projects would likely need to top up the cash shortfall, and hence, this would result in higher net gearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Uneven revenue bookings leading to fluctuation in earnings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Revenue recognition for Chinese developers is based upon on delivery of the units. Hence, the timing of the construction completion is influential on the underlying earnings being reported. Nevertheless, there is no consistency in construction completion, which leads to wide fluctuations in earnings (i.e. % of revenue recognition/net profit in 1H fluctuates without a consistent pattern/trend). Specifically, revenue recognized/net profit in 1H made up 37-47%/37-40% of total revenue/net profit, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be selective; we prefer state-owned developers over private developers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While the falling Chinese stock market presents new risks to the Chinese economy and property market, we now see a rising likelihood of additional policy support for the property markets in Tier-2/3/4 cities (yet tighter policies for Tier-1 cities). This should provide support for quality state-owned property names, and we now see good opportunities to buy COLI, CR Land, Joy City, Greentown and Franshion. However, valuation multiple expansions for lesser-quality names should have ended. We maintain Sell on names with high leverage, a record of aggressive acquisitions or slowing growth: Sunac, Shimao, Evergrande, Country Garden, Yuexiu, Yanlord, Agile and Gemdale.</span></p>
