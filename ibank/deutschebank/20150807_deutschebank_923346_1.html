<p><span class="font2">What did the local news say?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to news from Shipping Industry (ia®^) this afternoon, Cosco Group and China Shipping Group intend to jointly set up a reform leading group to discuss possible merger/reform between the two groups. The reform leading group is expected to develop a preliminary reform plan within the next three months. Per the same news, the establishment of the leading group is only the first step, and the complete merger between the two groups is expected to finish around 2017.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A shares of CSD, China Cosco, and CSCL all hit up limits today, while H shares soared 12.5%, 13.6%, and 23.9%, respectively. Trading of the three companies (both A and H) will be halted starting next Monday.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">DB view:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A merger looks entirely likely. As we highlighted in our FITT report &quot;China to re-shape global shipping&quot; issued on March 5, 2015, the State Council specifically mentioned (last October when issuing opinions on the Chinese shipping sector) the &quot;enhancefd] competiveness of Chinese shipping lines by speeding up M&amp;As within the industry and promoting scale operation and specialization&quot;. As market share matters a lot for container shipping, we concluded in the same report that the government might encourage a merger between CSCL and Coscon (container division of China Cosco). While a merger is certainly possible, how it would be carried out (e.g. group level merger or listco merger) remains unclear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even factoring in a merger, valuations for SOE carriers look expensive (except CSD-H). We conducted a scenario analysis on mergers when we turned more cautious on Chinese carriers in early June. Our base case suggests that a combined firm (i.e. CSCL+Coscon), assuming successful cost reductions and rising pricing power, would lift its ROE to 5.2% (vs. -2.6% for CSCL and 0.2% for Coscon on a standalone basis in 2014). However, if we use current freight rates, even factoring in merger synergies, we calculate that the combined firm would incur negative 10% ROE. As lines continue to order mega ships, industry returns in the long run are likely to remain depressed. Using average rates since GFC, ROE for the combined firm would be -1.3%. Currently, CSCL-H and China Cosco-H trade at 1.2x P/B and 1.7x P/B, respectively, neither of which looks cheap against prospective returns. A shares of the three companies are way too expensive (1.7x-4.8x P/Bs), in our opinion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Investors should position on CSD-H. The company already turned around in 1H and should produce a stronger profit in 2H, but its H share still trades at 0.6x P/B. This should offer investors solid downside protection, which we consider extremely important in the current volatile market. Moreover, as we have noted before, if the merger occurs, we believe CSD is highly likely to be involved given that China Cosco has both dry bulk and container operations. The three listcos could be combined into two platforms. One would include the CSCL and Coscon. Another would consist of CSD, the dry bulk division of China Cosco, and possibly Cosco Dalian, the tanker leg of Cosco Group.</span></p>
