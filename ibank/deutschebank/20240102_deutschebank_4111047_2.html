<p><span class="font1">wasgrowingtalkabouta'nolanding’ scenario. Unlikethe hard or soft landings, this scenario had inflation staying high whilst growth remained strong, meaning that the Fed would need to hike rates even more to bear down on inflation. At the start of March, thatsaw Fed Chair Powell say in hissemi-annualcongressional testimony that &quot;we would be prepared to increase the pace of rate hikes&quot;, which explicitly opened the door to larger 50bp hikes again. Shortly afterwards on March 8, 2yr Treasury yields closed at a post-2007 high of 5.07%, and expectations of the Fed's terminal rate stood ata new high for the cycle of 5.69%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However, that all changed swiftly with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which raised fears about broader contagion across the financial system. For instance on March 13, yields on 2yr Treasuries saw their largest daily decline since 1982, surpassing the daily moves during the GFC, after 9/11, and on Black Monday in 1987. Meanwhile in Europe, Credit Suisse then came under investor scrutiny and saw large deposit outflows, which culminated in a purchase by UBS that included guarantees from the Swiss government. That led to major bond moves in Europe too, and on March 15 as concern grew about Credit Suisse, the 2yr German yield saw its largest daily decline in data going back to reunification in 1990. US banks saw a massive underperformance as a result, and the KBW Bank index was down by -24.9% in March in total return terms. And more broadly, the MOVE index of Treasury volatility rose to levels last seen at the height of the GFC in 2008. This concern lingered for some weeks, and on May 1, First Republic Bank was closed andJPMorgan acquired most of its assets. But by June, markets had calmed for the most part, and the VIX index of volatility was at a post-pandemic low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Otherwise in Q2, a big story was growing excitement about the potential for Al, particularly after Nvidia raised their outlook far above expectations thanks to demand for Al processors. This meant that the Magnificent 7 were one of the top equity performers in 2023, with a total return of +107% over the year as a whole. Nvidia itself saw the strongest performance in the entire S&amp;P 500, with a gain of +239% over the year, whilst Meta also saw a very strong +194% advance as well. Thatgroup of stocks helped the S&amp;P 500 record a +2 6.3% gain over 2023, although it's worth noting thatthe advance was driven by a relatively narrow group of stocks. Indeed, t he equal-weig hted S&amp;P 500 wasonly up+ 13.9% over the year, which is the biggest underperformance for the equal-weighted version compared to the S&amp;P 500 since 1998 during the dot com bubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alongside this, from April there was another round of concerns about the US debt ceiling as the latest deadline approached. There was a clear market reaction in response, including a noticeable widening in CDS spreads for the United States. Moreover, yields on T-bills that matured around the X-date in early June briefly traded with a 7 handle, showing how investors were demanding extra compensationtohold those bills at risk of default. But a deal was eventually reached on May 27, and was signed into law by President Biden on June 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The continuation of positive economicnewsmeantthat central banks retainedtheir focus on persistent inflation, contrary to speculation about a pause after the regional bankingturmoil. Forinstance, theFed hiked again in May, and in Junetheir dot plot still signalled two more rate hikes for 2023. That came as the data remained very positive, and at the time they showed nonfarm payrolls had grown by +294k in April and another +339k in May. Then in July, the Fed hiked once again, taking rates up to a 22-year high.</span></p>
