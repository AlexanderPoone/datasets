<p><span class="font1">dropped below 50 in November. What would also helpthe PBOC's rate cut decision is the fact that the CNY has appreciated to 7.15 from the —7.3 line which PBOC has been holding since its last rate cut in August.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Weeks ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">China has the Central Economic Work Conference is upcoming in December. As is outlined in our 2024Outlook, we expectfiscal policy to be more supportive next year with 1.5 - 2% of GDP expansion in fiscal deficit, and monetary policy will also likely ease further to accommodate fiscal expansion and bring down real interest rates. Key 2024 policy parameters such as the growth target (we expect &quot;above 4.5&quot;) and budget deficit (we expect 3.8% of GDP) will also be discussed at the meeting, but will not be announced until in March at the National People's Congress. On the November economic activities, we expect industrial production, retail sales and fixed asset investment to grow by 6%yoy, 13%yoy and 3%yoy ytd, respectively, thanks to favorable base effects. CPI and PPI are expected to rebound mildly to -0.1 %yoy and -2.4%, respectively. M 2 growth is likely to slow to 10% due to the high base in last year. We also think the PBOC will likely cut its MLF rate by 15bps to 2.35% in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hong Kong CPI is forecasted to increase by 2.8%yoy in November, and unemployment rate to stay unchanged at 2.9%. Trade data is likely to improve thanks to the low base in last year, with the exports growing by 5.4% and 4.4%, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">India's November CPI inflation is expected to come out at 5.78%yoy, almost 90bps higher than the 4.89% outturn in October. This will likely constitute a +0.8%mom increase in Nov headline CPI vs. +0.7%mom in Oct. The reasons for the uptick are: i) an unfavorable base; and ii) a spike in onion and tomato prices during Nov, which is likely to push headlineCPI inflation once again closetothe upperthreshold mark of 6.0%. Unless, vegetable prices decline sharply, CPI inflation will likely stay around similar levels in December as well, but thereafter will moderate to 5.0% average in Jan-March'24, as new crops arrive at the market. We are forecasting food and core CPI prices to be up + 1.1%mom and +0.4%mom, respectively, which results in a headline CPI print of 5.78%yoy and unchanged core CPI (RBI definition: CPI ex food and fuel) at 4.3%yoy. October IP growth likely at 10.4%yoy, aided by a favorable base and &quot;Diwali holiday effect&quot;. We are forecasting the trade deficit to moderate to USD25.7bn in Nov, after a sharp spike in October to USD31.5bn, due to a one-off Diwali festival-related surge in gold and other imports. We expect exports to decline 5.7%yoy, while imports should grow at 2.9%yoy in Nov. In 2H FY24, we expect the current account deficit to widen to USD42.3bn, resulting in a total CAD of USD61.5bn for FY24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sri Lanka's real GDP growth is expected to turn positive in July-Sep'23 to 2.5%yoy (vs. -3.1 %yoy in April-June'23), due to an exceptionally favorable base of last year (in July-Sep'22, real GDP had contracted 11.5%yoy). We are forecasting Sri Lanka's real GDP to grow 3.0%yoy and 3.5% in 2024 and 2025 respectively vs. a likely outturn of -2% in 2023 and -7.8% in 2022. A 3-3.5%yoy growth outturn is not impressive, considering the favorable base of 2023, but given the multi-prong challenges, Sri Lanka will likely have to contend with lower growth for the time being. Tourism revenues will be a key support for Sri Lanka's growth, which we thinkcouldincreasesequentially through 2024 and beyond, but this by itself will not be sufficient to drive growth sustainably higher above 3%yoy.
