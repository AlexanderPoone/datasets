<p><span class="font1">27% of our coverage rose in USD in July (while 53% outperformed)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sector took another step back in July, with only 27% of our covered stocks having positive returns in USD terms, versus June's 37%, even though slightly more (53% vs. 43%) outperformed their respective country indices. Retail was again the weakest sector (down 10% on average) but Cosmetics/HPC trailed closely (down 9% on average, driven by high-teen-% declines in NATU3 and HYPE3), while Food was again the most defensive (down 2%). We continue to advocate caution on many blue-chip large-cap names; instead, our preference remains for under-appreciated names both on the low end (BIMBOA.MX, CCU, AKOb) and high end (MRFG3, BEEF3) of the risk curve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Sector earnings generally disappointing in 2Q15, with a few exceptions Now that over 2/3 of our covered companies have reported 2Q1 5 earnings, we can make a preliminary assessment of whether sector earnings are exceeding or falling short of market expectations right after the quarter's closing. Like in 1Q15 (when operating results fell slightly short of market expectations), 2Q15 is tracking at a 3% EBITDA shortfall and a 1% EPS shortfall, on average. Also, the percentage of companies that have surprised by more than 5% is low (13% at the EBITDA level and 16% at the EPS level).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Walmex comp sales a bit ahead of expectations likely from Friday month end The leading Mexican retailer reported July SSS growth in Mexico of 6.0% (with flat traffic, thus all from higher ticket), one point above our 5.0% estimate. July 2014 was a &quot;normal&quot; month (in last year's context) and, therefore, a 6% print is a bit better than expected and is probably explained by the fact that the last day of the month was on a Friday. SSS growth looking at comparable 4-week periods was 5.4%, which would support the view that the difference stemmed from the Friday month end. In any event it was a small positive surprise that in our view is more than priced in given the recent strength in the shares (which we continue to think are fairly valued, at best).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beer and soft drink production in Brazil remains weak even on normalized basis According to SICOBE, production of beer and soft drinks fell again in July (volumes were down 6.9% and 14.9%, respectively). Beer comparisons (+2.9% in July 2014) were still above normal (though substantially easier than in the previous five months) as this was the last month to have a World Cup base effect. Soft drink comparisons were harder, but in our view most of the weakness in production in this category (a 5-year record decline) stemmed from the worsening Brazilian economy (which was again evident in the 3-year CAGRs: -0.6% for beer and -3.3% for soft drinks).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BR protein exports: USD prices still down across the board (but single-digit rate for beef shows continued relative pricing power)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">July data from SECEX showed a 59% increase in pork and a 23% decline in beef export volumes, accompanied by price declines of 26% (on a tough comp caused by the PED outbreak in the US) and 5% in USD terms, respectively. As in June, poultry volumes spiked up 22% but with dollar prices continuing to fall (16%). Brazil beef continues to have the most pricing power (in other words, has had to &quot;share&quot; a much lesser percentage of the positive impact of BRL devaluation on local-currency prices) among Brazilian proteins given the global supply constraints.</span></p>
