<h2><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>2024 Outlook: Fed WINs in '24, but at what cost?</span></h2>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The USeconomywasvery resilient in 2023. Accordingly, we have become more optimistic on the outlook over the past year. That said, recent data suggest the labor market is more clearly slowing and consumers may be pulling back as long-anticipated headwinds hit. Our forecast of a mild recession in H1 2024 is thus little changed since our last update in October.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to anticipate a downturn driven primarily by softening in consumer spending and capex starting in Q1 2024 in which real GDP falls about 0.6 percentage points. Growth should rebound to an above-potential rate during late-2024/early-2025. This forecast sits between a soft landing, in which inflation is tamed without much upward movement in unemployment, and historical examples of recession, where the unemployment rate rises at least two percentage points.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fiscal policy and the US election will be in focus. We expect federal spending to evolve broadly in line with the debt ceiling deal, while further belt tightening on a shutdown agreement is a downside risk. The outcome of the election is highly uncertain, and differences in the number of seats in play by party highlightthe potential fora split Congress. The candidates will likely push for different fiscal priorities but largely continue recent strategies towards China.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The labor market has come into better balance. Some further slowing in payrolls and stabilization in unemployment would be consistent with a soft landing. Nonetheless, the pace of softening, as well as a weakening in leading indicators and intensifying headwinds, leave us expecting a further deterioration in the months ahead. We expect the unemployment rate to peak at 4.6% in 2024 and then slowly converge back to 4% in 2026.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Progresson inflation should also continue. Aided by a softereconomy, core inflation should end 2024 about 30bps above the Fed's target - close enough for the Fed to declare they have whipped inflation now (WIN). Still, near-term progress could be bumpier, and there is tentative evidence that the inflation trend may stabilize around 3% without a softereconomy. As such, a more positive outcome for the economy could also delay some of the inflation progress we anticipate.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent data strengthen our conviction that the Fed is done raising rates. Further out, our expectations for rate cuts are unchanged: the first cut is in June; there are 175bpstotal cuts in 2024; and thefed funds rate likely settles near its nominal neutral level of ~3.1 %in 2025. If the economy accelerates, particularly with above-target inflation and looser financial conditions, the risk of further hikes is greater than implied by market pricing.</span></p></li></ul>
