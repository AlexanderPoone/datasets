<p><span class="font5">Pre-positioning for more supportive policies and improving supply p</span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">icture </span><span class="font2">Valuations returned to more reasonable levels; more positive catalysts ahead Since stock market corrections in late May, valuations of Chinese developers have returned to levels at end-1 Q15, and the sector now trades at NAV discount (39% market-cap weighted), PE (7.Ox) and PB (0.9x) that are all close to &quot;-1SD&quot; of historical ranges. In the physical market, residential sales volume has remained solid YoY and should sequentially pick up starting Sep as new launches turn active. Also, we expect more supportive government policies given weak macro, while demand-supply in property market should continue to improve (inventory situations normalizing and future new supply falling), which should lead to better pricing power for good projects. Buy quality SOE names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More supportive government policies on property market expected in 2H15 In our view, in addition to the recent A-share market collapse and its not-fully-known impacts on the economy, the recent signs of an accelerating slowdown in the Chinese economy (shown by latest weaker-than-expected macro statistics like exports and imports, PPI and non-food CPI in July 2015) could well result in a more supportive and accommodative policy environment for the property market (with the likely exception of Shenzhen, Beijing and Shanghai where property prices have risen fast in 1H15). The more supportive policy environment should support better property sales for 2H15. As a reference, in the past, whenever the Chinese economy was weak, the government tended to adopt more supportive policies on the China property market, and such supportive policies have typically boosted property sales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More favorable demand-supply picture and pricing power for 2H15 and 1H16 On our analysis, from the data of the 37 cities we tracked, the overall inventory period, as calculated by taking available-for-sale properties (completed and under construction) divided by the latest monthly sales volume, has fallen back to about 12 months - back to the historical average. More importantly, inventory periods for the Tier-1 cities and major Tier-3/4 cities have fallen below historical average levels. Such improvements, and the continued YTD declines in residential land sales and new construction starts, should lead to a more favorable demand-supply balance, and better pricing power even for the normal Tier-2/3/4 cities in 2H15 and 1H16. In our view, these should benefit the state-owned developers which normally have more stable gross margins and improving net margins (due to more carefully chosen timing of land purchase (e.g., avoiding buying land aggressively when land prices were high) and locations of landbank (e.g., urban areas preferred to suburban areas).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Be selective: Buy COLI, CR Land, Greentown, Franshion, Joy City, Sino Ocean While the weak A-share market presents new risks to Chinese economy and property market, we now see a rising likelihood of additional policy support for the property markets (except for Shenzhen, Beijing, Shanghai), which should provide support for quality state-owned property names and we now see good opportunities to buy COLI, CR Land, Joy City, Greentown, Franshion, Sino Ocean. However, valuation multiple expansions for lesser quality names should end; and we should focus on company and industry fundamentals. We maintain Sell on names with high leverage, a record of aggressive acquisitions, continued margin pressure, or slowing growth: Sunac, Shimao, Evergrande, Country Garden, Yuexiu, Yanlord, Agile, Gemdale. We base our target prices on NAV discounts. Risks: unexpected economic, policy and political volatility.</span></p>
