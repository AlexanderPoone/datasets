<h2><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Hong Kong to boost tourism, focusing on business travel and cruise tourism</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">More measures need to be taken to boost HK tourism industry, says the Legislative Council Secretariat</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Legislative Council Secretariat (the Secretariat) announced a Research Brief on Hong Kong tourism industry on 5 August. It cited that tourism is one of the pillar industries in HK, while it saw significant deceleration since 2014. The sluggish tourism market in HK reflected some setbacks for HK local tourism industry, comprising inadequate investment, aging tourism resources, underscored service quality, etc, according to the Secretariat. Moreover, other tourism destinations, e.g. Japan and Korea which provides relaxing visa requirements, with favorable currency rate also diluted tourist traffic of HK. Hence, the secretariat suggested that HK needs to take more initiatives to diversify its tourism resources, attract more business travelers and promote cruise trip development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For business travel, overnight business travelers eyed remarkable growth in recent years with an annual growth of 4.5% from 2010-2014 to 3.8m, according to HKTB. Overnight meetings, incentive travels, conventions and exhibitions (MICE) visitors also amounted to 1.8m in 2014 with annual growth of 9.3% during the same period. Per capital spending of business tourists amounted to HKD9,504 in 2014 at CAGR of 5.7% from 2004-2014, vs. HKD7,713 per capita for non-business travelers in HK. While amid keen competition with other Asian tourism destinations, HK is lagging behind in terms of incentive themes to promote MICE industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For cruise tourism, Kai Tak Cruise Terminal that has been invested with HKD8.2bn needs further improvement, which is tough in short term. The linkage system including the environmental friendly public transport modes to connect the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal with nearby MTR stations is still under valuation and assessment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">HK tourist arrivals saw slight growth of 2.8% in 1H15, slowest since 3009 According to HKTB, total tourist arrivals in HK in June was up 2.9% to 4.4m people, among which mainland tourists amounted to 3.3m , increasing 1.8% yoy. For first half 2015, total tourist arrivals increased 2.8% and Mainland tourists up 4.7%. Overnight/sameday visitor arrivals increased 3.8%/8.4% with Mainland up by 3.8%/10.6% respectively.</span></p>
