<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Source: Deutsche Bank, Bloomberg Finance LP</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">__________________________________________________ </span><span class="font3">Commentary for Friday: </span><span class="font2">Nonfarm payrolls are projected to rise 235k in July. This compares to a trailing three-month moving average of 221 k and a year-to-date average of 208k. The projected July gain would lift the three-month moving average by 16k to 237k. This would be the fastest pace since February (265k)—the high for the current cycle is 324k for the three months ending December 2014. The projected mild acceleration in employment is consistent with the recent downtrend in jobless claims and our expectation that currentquarter GDP will firm relative to Q2. Claims were at 255k during the July employment survey week, which was the lowest level since 1973. This compares to 268k during the June employment survey week. Meanwhile, the four-week moving average during the employment survey week was effectively unchanged in July (279k) compared to June (277k).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Last quarter, real GDP grew 2.3% but output is expected to expand at a 3.0% annualized rate this quarter, as the effects of energy-related investment dissipate. Unless productivity growth improves, the added growth must come from greater labor input— more jobs and/or longer hours. As we wrote yesterday, it appears that 02 output will be revised higher, up to 3.1% on the back of stronger-than-assumed construction spending, inventories and net exports. If this indeed turns out to be the case, we may revise up our estimate of current-quarter growth. Remember that in the residual seasonality that both we and the San Francisco Fed have observed in the GDP data, the payback from 01 weakness has tended to occur in 03.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With respect to the unemployment rate, it slipped from 5.508% in May to 5.285% in June; we expect it to stay at 5.3% in July. Assuming a steady labor force participation rate, it will take job growth of about 100k per month to keep the rate at 5.3% over time. Thus, if the labor market continues to generate 200k+ jobs per month, the unemployment rate will break 5% by yearend. This is probably the primary reason that Fed policymakers want to act on interest rates this year. The ongoing decline in unemployment has been large enough and persistent enough for Chair Yellen and her colleagues to begin considering the long process of interest rate normalization as the economy gets closer to full employment or the NAIRU (i.e., the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment). However, there is still little evidence of any wage pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Average hourly earnings are projected to rise 0.2%, which would lift the year-over-year rate by a couple of tenths to 2.2%. This would be within the 1.8% to 2.3% band that has prevailed since last 2012 and would also be consistent with the 2% year-over-year gains seen in both the employment cost index and compensation per hour, which are broader measures of wage pressure. Eventually, we expect labor costs to accelerate in response to a tightening labor market but unfortunately neither we nor the Fed knows where the NAIRU is. We will only know the NAIRU after the fact, once wage gains begin to meaningfully outstrip productivity such that unit labor costs are growing rapidly. Over the last four quarters, unit labor costs have risen a modest 1.8%, so it is not inconceivable that we are still not yet at the NAIRU.</span></p>
