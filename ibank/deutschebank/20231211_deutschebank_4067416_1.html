<p><span class="font1">Bl, BSpand CBC to keep their policy rates steady, while PBoC cuts by 15bps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The CBC looks set to keep its policy rate steady on 14 December. There is no change in our view that the CBC will keep its policy rate unchanged through end-2024. Despite our assumption of significantly lower US rates (the Fed to cut rates by 175bps in 2024), the CBC will likely remain on the sidelines, as GDP growth rebounds to 3% in 2024, led by semi exports. I n particular, the TWSE semi industry has continued totrend higher, hinting at a continued improvement in semi exports ahead. While the TWSE recovered sharply in recent weeks with the easing of US rates, housing prices have also rebounded since mid-year. That said, CPI inflation is likely to moderate to 1.5% in 2024, from 2.5% in 2023, barring commodity price shocks.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Bangko Sentral Ng Pilipinas (BSP) will likely also keep its policy rates steady on 14 December. We see the Philippines reporting relatively stable GDP growth of 5.4% in 2024, with inflation falling below the upper band of the central bank's target range, albeit with an annual average of 4.1% in 2024 vs. 6.1% in 2023. This fall in inflation, together with the Fed's rate cuts (our US team expects 225bps of rate cuts by the Fed from mid-24 to Q1 -25) would allow BSP to lower rates aggressively in 2024, by 150bps, starting around mid-24 as well, without seeing the peso becoming unanchored. Until then, we see BSP staying on the sidelines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bank I ndonesia (Bl) will likely keep its policy rate steady on 21 December. Although inflation surprised slightly to the upside for the month of October, it remained well within the target range of 1.5% and 3.5%, at 2.9%. Looking ahead, we see a combination of stable growth at 5% through 2024, from 2023, and limited inflationary pressure (averaging slightly above 3% in 2024) allowing Bl to lower its policy rates. Moreover, the Fed's pivot (175bps rate cuts in 2024) should provide sufficient room for Bl to cut rates by 100bps during the same period, barring unexpected sharp moves in the rupiah.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The People's Bank of China (PBOC) isan outlier; we expect it will cut the 1-year MLF rate by 15bps to 2.35% on 15 December. We think it appropriate for the PBOC to cut in response to recent softness in activity and prices. China's headline CPI inflation dropped below zero in October and is expected to stay negative in November. Manufacturing PMI stayed below 50 in the past 2 months, while services PMI also</span></p>
