<h1><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Solid Fundamentals Poor Perceptions &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">|/|</span></h1>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">■ Equity markets remain squarely focused on the macro outlook. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">For over a year, the economist consensus has been steadfast in calling for a sharp slowing, even as personal consumption, the largest component of spending, has grown trend-like; and lending standards, a key channel for the transmission of higher rates, eased recently Despite above-trend growth, core inflation has fallen, driven by steep declines in the unexplained component (besides unemployment and the dollar) as factors idiosyncratic to the pandemic recovery eased. Continued declines would see inflation back in its pre-pandemic range without slow growth. The 1970s inflation experience likely precludes rate cuts unless recession materializes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Earnings growing solidly, though perceptions remain poor; valuations do not look high. S&amp;P 500 EPS </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fell in H2 2022, then grew solidly in 2023 to reach a new high in Q3. Perceptions remain poor, tied to still low yoy (year-on-year) growth, LTM earnings and low corporate visibility. This may change with Q4 reporting when yoy growth is set to approach 10%. For 2024, the house economics view with a mild short US recession implies $250 (+10%). If instead we get somewhat above trend GDP growth, which was exceeded in the last 5 quarters, we see EPS of $271 (+19%). Are valuations high? No. We see fair value at 18x, which happens to be the middle of the 16x-20x range of the last 2 years, rising to the top on pricing a recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2024 year-end S&amp;P 500 target 5100. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">We see the multiple well supported at 20x and our base case for EPS remains $250 but allowing for some continued roll forward of the timing of the macro slowdown, we set a target of 5100; our upside scenario with EPS of $271 with some multiple expansion points to 5500. We discuss a number of catalysts that will impact the trajectory: rates vs rates vol; the playbook for geopolitical risks; the selloff around the widely anticipated mild short recession; the Presidential election; and the large potential productivity (and output) upside from tight labor markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sectors and regions. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">At the sector level, we remain neutral Mega-Cap Growth &amp;&nbsp;Tech, overweight the Financials and Consumer Cyclicals; turn overweight Materials; remain neutral the Industrials and Energy; and underweight the Defensives. At the regional level, we look for broadly similar returns from current levels in Europe as the US over the coming year but are tactically overweight; move Japan to underweight where we see relative performance tied to the yen. We are neutral EM as the discount reflects falling estimates.</span></p>
