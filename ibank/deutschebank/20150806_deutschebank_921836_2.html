<p><span class="font1">Standard Chartered - Earnings miss, capital beat (2888.HK, Sell, Target Price: HKD 104.00, Closing Price: HKD 117.00, David Lock)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Standard Chartered has reported 1H15 results this morning. Numbers are a miss to our forecasts: stated PBT printed at $2,098m vs. forecast of $3,168m. Adjusted PBT for 1H15 (excludes own credit ($55m), gains on business sold ($219m) and restructuring costs ($35m) was $1,859m, which compares with our forecast of $2,768m. Within the P&amp;L, income was 2% miss, costs were 2% higher (excluding restructuring), impairments were higher at $1.6bn vs $1bn forecast. On asset quality, the CEO's statement does not suggest an improvement in 2H15: &quot;The loan impairment outcome for the first half and the increase in non-performing loans is a continuation of adverse trends, and there are no signs of these reversing.&quot; (David Lock - 44 20 754-11521) </span><a href="http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1713-7709/92150089/0900b8c08a03aec7.pdf"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1713-7709/92150089/0900b8c08a03aec7.pdf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">Songcheng Performance - Strong 1H15 growth - inline with our estimate, reiterate Buy (GAME.HK, Buy, Target Price: CNY 79.00, Closing Price: CNY 63.50, Tallan Zhou) Songcheng announced its 1H15 earnings today with net profit increasing 66% yoy to RMB 263m, in-line with company guidance and our estimate. Revenue grew 47% yoy to RMB 573m, driven by strong performance of cultural shows in Sanya, Lijiang and Jiuzhaigou Valley. We reiterate our Buy recommendation with a target price of RMB79. (Tallan Zhou - 852 2203 6464) </span><a href="http://Dull.db-qmresearch.eom/D/975-5BEC/92786492/0900b8c08a0362d3.Ddf"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://Dull.db-qmresearch.eom/D/975-5BEC/92786492/0900b8c08a0362d3.Ddf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">Autohome - 2Q15: a hint of macro headwinds: hiring hike planned in 2H (ATHM.N, Hold, Target Price: USD 42.50, Closing Price: USD 39.23, Vivian Hao)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Autohome reported 2Q revs of RMB861m (+%70YoY/+38%QoQ), largely in line with DBe and beating consensus by 2%. Non-GAAP NP of RMB325m was 12% above both DBe and consensus thanks to strong operating leverage. 3Q revs guidance of 56%-62%% YoY is largely in-line with DBe and ahead of consensus at 56%. We expect headwinds in auto sales could adversely impact budget allocation on premium ad products (e.g. dealer ads) while the investment in new transaction-centric models could lag margins in 2H15. (Vivian Hao - 852 2203 6241) </span><a href="http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/2049-FF40/95162994/0900b8c089fcd2da.pdf"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/2049-FF40/95162994/0900b8c089fcd2da.pdf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hysan Development - Rich valuations; more challenging HK retail outlook ahead (0014.HK, Sell, Target Price: HKD 27.66, Closing Price: HKD 33.90, Tony Tsang)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While Hysan’s 1H15 underlying net profit was up YoY, we remain cautious on Hysan as the pace of deterioration of the HK retail market is accelerating, and we believe it is just the beginning of a multi-year structural de-rating. With the softening trend in tourist arrivals, stretched financial position of local households and potential negative wealth impact associated with the recent stock market volatility, we expect further downward pressure on retail sales, which will ultimately drag retail rents. We also expect downside pressure on NAV to emerge as the interest rate hike cycle gets closer. Current valuations appear rich with a 26% discount to our NAV and dividend yield of only 3.7%. (Tony Tsang - 852 2203 6256) </span><a href="http://Pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1591-7F93/3915387/0900b8c08a022088.pdf"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://Pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1591-7F93/3915387/0900b8c08a022088.pdf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">HK Telecom Trust - A good 1H15 result though momentum likely to slow (6823.HK, Hold, Target Price: HKD 10.00, Closing Price: HKD 9.11, Peter Milliken)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HKT Trust continued its solid momentum in 1H15, reporting a 23% YoY rise (11 % Hoh) in Adjusted Funds Flow per share. While the industry wide effort to reprice mobile plans and continued cost outs from the CSL acquisition should support HKT's EBITDA growth over the next two years, we expect these to be partially offset by continued intense price competition in fixed broadband, a normalization in tax, interest costs and capex spend. As such we expect dividend growth to slow beyond 1H15 and retain the HOLD rating. (Peter Milliken - 852 2203 6190) </span><a href="http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1285-235B/5528071/0900b8c08a03fae2.pdf"><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://pull.db-qmresearch.eom/p/1285-235B/5528071/0900b8c08a03fae2.pdf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font1">CRE - 1HFY15 preview (0291.HK, Buy, Target Price: HKD 25.90, Closing Price: HKD 24.95, Anne Ling)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We expect CRE to report NP declining 28% yoy to RMB673m, on the back of a 13% increase in sales revenue to RMB94.7bn in 1H15. For 2015, we expect NP to drop 46% yoy to RMB310m.
