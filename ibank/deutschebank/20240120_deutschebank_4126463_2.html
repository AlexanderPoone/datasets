<p><span class="font0">Asia Week Ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">demand front, we suspect that net trade and destocking likely weighed heavily on growth. More importantly, the weakness in Q4 GDP left annual growth below Bank Negara Malaysia's (BNM's) forecast range of 4-5%. Looking ahead, while domestic demand growth may be supported by healthy payroll growth and &quot;continued progress of multi-year infrastructure projects and implementation of catalytic initiatives under the national master plans&quot;, as per BNM's prevailing </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">outlook,</span><span class="font1"> &quot;the strength of E&amp;E exports recovery and tourism spending may be questioned&quot;. Although it is likely to pass at theupcoming meeti ng and reiterate that the&quot;policy stance remains supportive of the economy&quot;, we expect BNM to strike a more dovish tone on growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) isdue to meet during the week of 22-26 January. We expect the MAS to keep its policy stance unchanged, given the strength of its economy, despite a faster-than-expected drop in inflation. GDP growth surprised sharply to the upside, accelerating to +2.8% YoY (+1.7% QoQsa), up from +1% (+1.3%), led by manufacturing (+3.2% YoY in Q4 vs. -4.2% in Q3). Construction growth gained further strength (rising to +9.1 % YoY in Q4 from +6.2% in Q3), while services growth moved sideways (+2.4% vs. +2.3%). Although headline CPI inflation fell at a faster-than-expected pace (to 3.6% YoY in November from 4.7% in October), led by transportation, core inflation stood largely stable at 3.2% (vs. 3.3% in the same period). We expect headline inflation to rise to 3.7% in December. The worsening conflict in the M iddle East poses upside risks to inflation in Asia, including Singapore. With regard to CPI inflation data releases, we expect Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Vietnam's inflation numbers to move more or less sideways. Vietnam is likely to report a sharp rise in exports, retail sales, and IP growth for the month of January, supported by low base effects. See Figure 7 for forecast details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Financial Condition Indicators</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Advanced Asian economies' financial conditions diverged during the past week, as illustrated in Deutsche Bank's FCIs below. Hong Kong and South Korea's FCIs tightened slightly, owing to pressure from the external market. Singapore's FCI eased due to a strong bond market, while Taiwan's FCI remained largely flat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Weeks in review</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">China's growth </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">slowed sequentially in Q4</span><span class="font1">, with prices having continued to face downward pressures from the downturn in the property sector and an insufficient recovery in aggregate demand. Consumer sentiment incurred a slight setback in Q4, but consumption was still the main growth driver in 2023. Judging from the mixed message in December data, we believe that China's economy may have passed another near-term trough, and that it ison track toimprove over the next few quarters, on the back of incremental policy support. We also believe that forceful and coordinated policy responses will be necessary to jump-startthe economy. The country's </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">fiscal stance</span><span class="font1"> is likely to be more supportive in 2024, with the budgetary deficit being 1.5-2% of GDP more expansionary. Total fiscal spending growth will likely surge to 8% in 2024. Monetary policy is expected to accommodate fiscal expansion. We continue to expect a total of 45bps of MLF rate cuts in 2024, but we now expectthe first rate cut to occur in March. We forecast that China's sequential growth will likely rebound in the first two quarters of 2024. We reiterate our growth forecast of 4.7% in 2024, with respective quarterly growth forecasts of 1.3%, 1.3%, 1.2%, and 1.1% for Q1-Q4 2024.</span></p>
