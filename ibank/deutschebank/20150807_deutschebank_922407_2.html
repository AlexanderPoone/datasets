<p><span class="font1">The sluggish tourism market in HK reflected some setbacks for HK local tourism industry, comprising inadequate investment, aging tourism resources, underscored service quality, etc, according to the Secretariat. Moreover, other tourism destinations, e.g. Japan and Korea which provides relaxing visa requirements, with favorable currency rate also diluted tourist traffic of HK. Hence, the secretariat suggested that HK needs to take more initiatives to diversify its tourism resources, attract more business travelers and promote cruise trip development.

<p><span class="font1">China Biologic Products - Overdelivered with a bang (CBPO.OQ, Buy, Target Price: USD 149.00, Closing Price: USD123.43, Jack Hu)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CBPO reported revenue/non-GAAP EPS of USD79m/1.06 in 2015, vs. consensus of 72m/0.85 and our estimate of 72m/0.92. These represent YoY growth of 32%/30% respectively. Robust growth was driven by above-industry production volume growth, robust growth for flagship products as well as better-than-expected operating leverage. We highlight that both albumin and IVIG experienced 2.2%/2.3% ex-FX ASP growth in 2015 due to VAT reduction and improved penetration. The company maintained guidance for 2015.

<p><span class="font1">Melco Crown - Cost initiatives to benefit 2H; 2Q hurt by bad luck (MPELOQ, Sell, Target Price: USD 20.00, Closing Price: USD 21.49, Karen Tang)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">MPEL's 2Q property EBITDA of US$205m was 6% below consensus. But mgmt said this included a US$5m impact from low VIP hold and another US$20m impact from very-low premium mass hold. Thus, luck-adj EBITDA was US$230m (-7% qoq, -33% yoy), in line with consensus. Luck-adj margin was flat qoq at 24%. Importantly, mgmt identified cost saving opportunities worth an annualized US$50m with benefits starting in 2H15. Aside from cuts in mktg spend &amp;&nbsp;corp expenses, a key part would be the transfer of staff (mainly dealers) from City of Dreams to Studio City which opens on 27th October. On back of this cost initiative, we lift 2016 EBITDA by 5%, and TP from US$18 to US$20. A key risk is an insufficient table quota at Studio City.

<p><span class="font1">CGN Power - Reiterate Sell on CGN ahead of mediocre 1H15 results (1816.HK, Sell, Target Price: HKD 2.90, Closing Price: HKD 3.63, Michael Tong)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">CGN is going to report its 1H15 results on 19 Aug 2015. Compared with market expectation of a 9% yoy growth for full year earnings, we expect 1H15 earnings will be less satisfactory at Rmb2.66bn or up 4% yoy. In 1H15, consolidated output down 2.7% yoy and its most profitable Daya Bay units saw a 23% yoy decline in output on maintenance, though this could be offset by the higher contribution from JV &amp;&nbsp;associates, which were loss-making in 1H14.

<p><span class="font1">ZJE announced that it has agreed to purchase an 80.614% stake in Zhejiang Hanghui Expressway Co. Ltd. (Hanghui) from Zhejiang Communications Investment Group (ZJE’s parentco) for a cash consideration of RMB1,699m. The implied P/B is 5.8x P/B, which looks higher than ZJE’s acquisition in Yongjin in 2013 (1.5x) and JSE’s acquisitions in Ningchang Zhenli and Xiyi in 2015 (1x-1.7x). However, management guided it normally uses DCF to value its acquisition target. It considers the I RR ratio as most important (above 8%) for M&amp;A. (Phyllis Wang)</span></p>
