<p><span class="font1">China Infrastructure Sector - Intensive government policy to boost 2H15 new orders; Buy CCC and CRCC (Phyllis Wang)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the past few weeks, intensive new fiscal policies and industry reform plans released by the government are consolidating financial support for infrastructure projects: 1) the first batch (c.Rmb300bn) of over Rmbltr special construction bond will be issued by two policies banks (China Development Bank and Agricultural Development Bank of China) in the near term; 2) the minimum I RR requirement of project income bond (mainly targeting infrastructure projects) that issued by local government has been loosened to 6% from 8%; and 3) railway investment and operation have further opened to private investors. In fact, the Chinese government has already released a guideline on the local government bond swap program, and the MoF, PBoC and CBRC have loosened control over the financing of local government financing vehicles in May. We believe these policies coupled with the issue of Rmb300bn government-backed special construction bond could boost constructors' new orders in 2H15, while other policies should benefit constructors' mid- to long-term outlook.

<p><span class="font1">According to news from Shipping Industry (¡fits^) this afternoon, Cosco Group and China Shipping Group intend to jointly set up a reform leading group to discuss possible merger/reform between the two groups. The reform leading group is expected to develop a preliminary reform plan within the next three months. Per the same news, the establishment of the leading group is only the first step, and the complete merger between the two groups is expected to finish around 2017.

<p><span class="font1">UPC reported RMB687m NPAT for 1H15 (+93% yoy) with RMB12bn revenue (-3% yoy), beating DBe NPAT/revenue of +70%/-4%, and consensus NPAT of RMB585m. Net of 1Q15 reported NPAT of RMB369m, UPC 2Q15 NPAT would have been RMB318m (+172% yoy). Noodle/milk tea/RTD tea sales were -7%/-18%/-6%, partly offset by strong &quot;Haizhiyan&quot; and ''Classmate Xiaoming&quot; sales (over RMB1.2bn). A 5.3ppt GPM improvement and higher interest capitalization contributed to the better-than-expected bottom line.

<p><span class="font1">SFUN delivered 2Q revs of US$211m (+25%YoY/+71%QoQ), beating DBe/consensus by 19%/5% on faster-than-expected ramp-up in e-commerce business, which GMV +3x QoQ. Non-GAAP OPM came in at 11% (-38%YoY), ahead of DBe by 4ppt and inline with consensus. Non-GAAP NP of US$20m was ahead of DBe/consensus at US$13m/US$10m. The co raised FY15 top-line guidance from 15% to 20%YoY on the back of sprouting new transaction-based EC business. In return, the co plans massive hiring (&gt;40K by YE15) and light monetization for market share gains. We expect continued margin erosion in 2H15. Maintain Hold.

<p><span class="font1">Prada - 3% Sales miss in Q2, with in-line underlying trends (1913.HK, Hold, Target Price: HKD 53.00, Closing Price: HKD 37.80, Francesca Di Pasquantonio)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Prada reported 1H sales of E1,823m sales, +4% yoy reported, 1.6% below our expectations of E 1,853m and implying a 3% top line miss in Q2. However what might look as a disappointing release hides some improvements in the underlying trends, and even if it is too early to call an inflection point, we believe that the outlook in not getting incrementally negative. Group organic growth in Q2 was 6%, which is substantially in line with our original assumptions despite slightly lower LFLs (-5% vs. -4% expected). On our unchanged EPS numbers, Prada is at 19.4x PE Cal 2016, 5% discount to global luxury sector, that we feel is correctly balancing the potential for a normalisation of the negative trends in Asia, the Miu Miu turnaround opportunity and the relatively low visibility on margins. Hold maintained. (Francesca Di Pasquantonio -39 02 86379-753)</span></p>
