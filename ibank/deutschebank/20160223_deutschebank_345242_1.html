<p><span class="font2">3SBio, Hengrui and CBPO stand out with strong growth acceleration in 4015 We track high frequency data for the flagship drugs from 13 selected drug companies. Hospital data suggested that growth in 4015 was clearly weaker than YTD 3015 and our expectation. We believe this is unlikely, due to data accuracy. 3SBio, Hengrui, CBPO and Dawnrays nevertheless enjoyed growth acceleration while Luye exhibited growth stabilization in 4015. For the full year, solid growth momentum was largely maintained for CBPO, CSPC, SBP and THDB with growth of 27%/26%/15%/18% in 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3SBio: Growth picked up in 4015 with 16% vs. 13%/14% in 3015/2015</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Growth for EPIAO, TPIAO and SEPO combined registered at 16% in 4015 vs. 13%/14% in 3015/2015. EPIAO/TPIAO achieved growth of 2%/25% in 4015 vs. 2%/19% in 3015 and 5%/21% in 2015, respectively. For the full year, the combined growth achieved 15% in 2015, vs. 21%/19% in 2014 and 2013.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hengrui: Growth acceleration in 4015 with 13% vs. 9%/9% in 3015/2015 Hengrui saw 13% growth in 4015 vs. 9%/9% in 3015/2015 for the eight products we track. Ai Li, Ai Su, Ai Heng, Atracurium, and Kai Te Li achieved 23%/4%/7%/5%/30% in 4015, compared with 7%/1 %/-2%/14%/19% in 3015 and 5%/3%/-2%/10%/18% in 2015. For the full year, the combined growth achieved 10% in 2015, vs. 14%/13%in 2014 and 2013.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">THDB: Growth deceleration in 4015 with 13% vs. 19%/19% in 3015/2015 Growth for THDB decelerated to 13% in 4015 vs. 19%/19% in 3015/2015 for the insulin products. Among them, Gansulin 30R had a 5% decrease in 4015 vs. -3%/6% in 3015/2015. For the full year, the combined growth achieved 18% in 2015, vs. 10%/19%in 2014 and 2013.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SBP: Growth slowdown in 4015 with 13% vs. 17%'16% in 3015/2015</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">SBP saw 13% growth in 4015 vs. 17%/’16% in 3015/2015 for its seven key products. Growth of five major products including Runzhong, Ganmei, Kaishi, Kaifen and Tiance was 40%/13%/-4%/17%/26% in 4015 vs. 50%/15%/-4%/20%/48% in 3015 and 49%/17%/-2%/20%/47% in 2015. For the full year, the combined growth achieved 15% in 2015, vs. 13%/9% in 2014 and 2013. We remind investors that growth for SBP is lower than the reported number as we only include seven key products instead of the entire product portfolio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CSPC: Growth deceleration in 4015 with 20% vs. 27%/27% in 3015/2015 CSPC achieved 20% YoY growth in 4015 vs. 27%/27% in 3015/2015.
