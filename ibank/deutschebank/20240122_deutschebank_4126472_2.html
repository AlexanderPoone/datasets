<p><span class="font2">A positiveturn in the semi cycle is likely tosee a more notable rise in advanced Asia economies' growth. Singapore's positive growth surprise supports our view, although geopolitical tensions in the Middle East pose greater downside risks to advanced Asia economies than to others in the region.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Despite elevated external risks, inflation has fallen faster than expected in Asia, supporting a more dovish policy tilt by the region's central banks. Putting the PBoC aside, our prevailing view remains that Asian central banks will start cutting rates in the mid-year, with Asian FX unlikely to appreciate against the US dollar on a sustained basis until the Fed's policy pivot, despite improvement in exports. Bl and BSP are calibrating the timing of their rate cuts, while BoK has turned neutral, although its policy easing is likely to kick off in July - together with MAS. Although the PBoC did not cut as expected, we see it doing so eventually. We continue to expect the BoK to deliver a total of 50bps in rate cuts, starting in July, joined by MAS in easing. Bl (100bps), BSP (150bps) and RBI (100bps) will be more aggressive with their rate cuts, also starting a tad earlier, in June. While our prevailing view has no change in rates by BNM, BoT, CBC and SBV, risks are tilted to the downside for the first two. While BoT holds firm against pressure, BNM may strike a more dovish tone on growt h. And, we see the PBoC delivering more rate cuts, after a brief pause.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Taiwan's election result has not prompted us to recalibrate our outlook for the economy, wealsodo notsee a compelling reason to rethink others atthis juncture. Indonesia is next in line for the election (on 14 February), followed by South Korea (10 April) and India's (April/May). Instead, the US election has a greater potential to provoke a rethink of our view on the region.</span></p>
