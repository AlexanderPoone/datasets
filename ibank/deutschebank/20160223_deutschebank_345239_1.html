<h2><a name="bookmark5"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark6"></a>Read-through for consumer space from Parkson Retail FY15 results</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Sportswear and cosmetics outperformed, in line with industry trend</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Parkson Retail (3368.HK, NR) reported core net profit down 80% yoy to RMB46m in FY15, mainly due to operating de-leverage. SSS declined by 8% (vs. a decline of 6.3% in 9M15), which implies a decline of 13% in 4015. This was mainly attributable to a challenging retail environment, volatility in the stock market, e-commerce, and evolving spending patterns. By product, sportswear (+2% yoy) and cosmetics (-2%) outperformed, which is in line with industry trends. Gold &amp;&nbsp;jewelry (-10%), groceries (-11%), men's fashion (-11%) and leather (-11%) underperformed. By contrast, NDWS (0825.HK, NR) saw strong gold &amp;&nbsp;jewelry growth in 3QCY15, helped by the gold rush.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Department stores have engaged in enrichment of merchandise/service Parkson's direct sales (11% of total GSP) were resilient, at RMB1.6bn in FY15, mainly driven by the company's efforts in: 1) the establishment of a buyer team and expansion to 30 agency brands, 2) the launch of three new private label brands, and 3) the rollout of multi-brand stores. For F&amp;B, it has signed a franchise agreement with four F&amp;B brands and launched two private labels in 4Q15. We believe the enrichment of the merchandise and service are in line with the industry trend, and will help department stores to gain competitive edge and improve margins in the long run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2016: shopping mall fits industry trend while standalone supermarkets are new for department stores</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Management believes the macro economy will be challenging for retailers this year. Parkson will target young and middle-class consumers to drive sales. It plans to open one shopping mall and one supermarket store in 2Q16. It also has two standalone supermarket stores in the pipeline. During the analyst meeting on 23 February, management commented that it operates 22 supermarket stores in its 56 existing department stores. These supermarket stores are profitable and their sales growth is sustainable in the Beijing, Shanghai and Kunming stores. We believe the shopping mall fits with consumer demand, as they need more of a lifestyle than a merchandise focus. Standalone supermarket stores are a new development for department stores since Lifestyle (1212.HK, Buy) opened a second Freshmart store in Shanghai in July 2013.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Cost control to cope with the challenging environment</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Similar as NWDS, Parkson plans to implement cost control measures and lower capex for department stores' refurbishment to offset declining sales revenue. Management did not comment on the store closure plan, but said 25 out of the 56 stores are loss-making, and half of the loss-making stores are young stores and in the ramp-up stage. For M&amp;A, they do not have a fixed target this year, but will review when an opportunity arises. The company had net debt of RMB665m as of end-2015 vs. net cash of RMBM bn as of Dec 2014. Its shares are trading at 0.6x FY15 PB.</span></p>
