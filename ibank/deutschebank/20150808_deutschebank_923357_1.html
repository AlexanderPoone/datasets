<h2><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Intensive government policy to boost 2H15 new orders; Buy CCC and CRCC</span></h2>
<p><span class="font2">Intensive policy to benefit 2H15 outlook for constructors</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the past few weeks, intensive new fiscal policies and industry reform plans released by the government are consolidating financial support for infrastructure projects: 1) the first batch (c.Rmb300bn) of over Rmbltr special construction bond will be issued by two policies banks (China Development Bank and Agricultural Development Bank of China) in the near term; 2) the minimum IRR requirement of project income bond (mainly targeting infrastructure projects) that issued by local government has been loosened to 6% from 8%; and 3) railway investment and operation have further opened to private investors. In fact, the Chinese government has already released a guideline on the local government bond swap program, and the MoF, PBoC and CBRC have loosened control over the financing of local government financing vehicles in May. We believe these policies coupled with the issue of Rmb300bn government-backed special construction bond could boost constructors' new orders in 2H15, while other policies should benefit constructors' mid- to long-term outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Domestic new orders started to recover recently; 40 outlook to improve further We expect CCC, CRCC and CRG to post a 5-10% yoy drop in new orders in 1H15, mainly a result of the lack of funding (primarily for non-rail projects) and adjustment of the railway bidding system. Based on our checks with CRG, CRCC, and CCC, new orders of rail projects have bottomed out since June, upon the completion of the adjustment of the bidding system in May. The bidding amount in July (c.RmblOObn) is equal to the size in 1H15. CRG’s and CRCC's new orders of non-railway projects have slightly recovered from 1H15 on the back of intensive policy easing. We expect new orders (from both rail and non-rail projects) to further pick up over the rest of 2015. We now forecast new order growth of 5-10% yoy for constructors in 2H15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1H15 results preview: earning should be largely in line with expectation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CRCC and CRG will release their interim results on 30 August and CCC on 28 August. We forecast rail constructors' (CCC, CRCC and CRG) net profit to grow 5-10% yoy in 1H15. CRCC and CRG recently announced completion of their A-share placements. We expect CCC's first batch of preferred stocks to be issued before the end of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Buy CCC and CRCC</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe fiscal policy easing could lift near-term market sentiment. New orders performance is constructors' key share price driver. Hence, we believe potential new orders pick-up may further support constructors' share price over the rest of 2015. Furthermore, the detailed local OBOR plans to be released before end-October could also improve the sentiment. CCC is our preferred stock among China constructors given its 1) inexpensive valuation and 2) good execution and risk management. CCC's dredging business spin-off in 4Q15 may further benefit its share price. We prefer CRCC to CRG mainly due to the former's cheaper valuation.</span></p>
