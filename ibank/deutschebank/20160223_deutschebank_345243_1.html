<p><span class="font3">Updating fiscal breakevens for EM oil producers</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In a special report included in our recent EM Monthly (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Updating fiscal breakevens for EM oil producers),</span><span class="font3"> we update our assessment of the oil price needed to balance the budgets of major EM oil producers, taking into account the Commodities research team's new crude forecasts. This provides an indication simultaneously of the pain thresholds and further adjustment required on the fiscal front for each country. Recent fiscal adjustments and/or currency weakness have led to the breakevens for most producers falling since our previous update (May-15). However, despite adjustments made by oil producers, breakevens for all countries remain above 2016 crude forecasts, due to the sharp drop in oil prices. In addition, national budget breakevens are generally still above the US tight oil incentive cost breakeven of USD 50-55/bbl. Therefore national budget breakevens suggest that even as the oil market rebalances next year as it anticipates a modeled supply-demand deficit in 2018, oil prices may still remain too low to return producer countries to budget surpluses.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Breakeven estimates for 2016 are highest for Bahrain and Colombia (the only countries with three-digit breakevens), while Kuwait, Mexico and Qatar are in comparatively the best shape, with breakeven prices around S50bbl. Russia has made some adjustment via both a contraction in expenditures and currency depreciation; therefore breakevens have fallen since our last update. Mexico and Colombia fall at different ends of the breakeven spectrum, with Colombia the most exposed country in our analysis and Mexico among the least vulnerable due to aggressive fiscal consolidation. Lagging fiscal adjustment in Colombia has meant that it is the only country to see a large increase in the breakeven price between 2015 and 2016.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Mexico: International reserves are expected to drop due to FX interventions</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In Mexico, the weekly variation of the International reserves is due out today and we project -USD$600m. In our view, the level of international reserves deserves close attention as it will give an idea of the magnitude of discretionary FX market interventions carried out between Wednesday 17 and Friday 19). The Exchange Commission announced such interventions to support the MXN but for obvious reasons did not specify intended amounts. The disposal of international reserves will allow us to assess the potential effectiveness and sustainability of discretionary interventions.</span></p>
