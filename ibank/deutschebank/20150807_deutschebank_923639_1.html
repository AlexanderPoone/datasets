<h3><a name="bookmark3"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark4"></a>Listed brokers reported July earnings falling from June's peak</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Key focus of the week - brokers' July earnings came off from June's peak</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this note, we reiterate our positive stance on Chinese brokers and review the key market trends: 1) listed brokers reported lower earnings in July than June (-49% mom), but YTD earnings growth is still notably strong (+286% yoy); 2) we estimate that the CSF emergency fund is currently making returns of between -3% and 9%; 3) two developments on capital market liberalisation - Huatai’s ABS issuance backed by margin financing, resumption of secondary market issuance, which had received CSRC preliminary approval; 4) margin financing balance fell to Rmb1.3tr, with stable collateral coverage ratio. On our estimates, H-share brokers are trading at 1.28x 2015 P/B and 8.6x 2015 P/E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Brokers' July earnings came off from June's peak; YTD earnings still strong The 19 A+H listed brokers reported net profits of Rmb11.6bn for July 2015, up 197% yoy, but down 49% mom. In 7M15, their net profits amounted to Rmb97.6bn, up 286% yoy, and implying annualised growth of 219% yoy (Figure 1). The weaker July earnings were a result of 1) falling ADT in July, by 30% mom, to Rmb1.2tr, from Rmb1.7tr in June; 2) a lower margin financing balance, with the monthly average balance in July dropping by 30%, to Rmb1.5tr, from Rmb2.2tr in June; 3) MTM losses on proprietary investment, with SHCOMP recording a single-month decline of 14.3% in July. However, we do not think the weaker earnings represent a surprise to the market, as current valuations already reflect a pessimistic earnings outlook, with full-year ADT of Rmb606bn for H-share brokers (Figure 21).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tracking MTM return of government emergency fund - currently -3% to 9% Our three proprietary studies suggest that the government emergency fund is likely making mark-to-market returns of between -3% and 9%. We proxy the investment performance of the government emergency fund by monitoring returns of 1) the top 10 stocks purchased via four branches of CITIC Securities, in which CSF was reported to have opened accounts (Figure 2), 2) four blue-chip ETFs (Figure 4), and 3) five newly launched mutual funds subscribed by CSF (Figure 6).</span></p>
