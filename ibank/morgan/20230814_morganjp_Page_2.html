<p><span class="font5">a widening gap between the parallel and official exchange rates. Given the government's relatively positive showing in the Province of Buenos Aires and the persistent chance of advancing to a second round, the official FX rate is likely to under a strong grip albeit at the increasing cost of continued reserve depletion and a deepening of external imbalances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On a related note, we must acknowledge the upside risks to our already elevated monthly inflation projections for August, September, and October. These risks stem from the uncertain policy trajectory that the country is poised to nav igate and a widening FX gap. Also, as the government coalition seeks to secure a spot in the ballotage, the prospect of implementing comprehensive fiscal consolidation, including corrective spending measures, appears unlikely, even in light of commitments under the IMF program.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In summation, the existing financial landscape is set to deteriorate further, potentially exerting an influence on the October elections. The interplay between economic dynamics and political maneuvering underscores the complexity of the situation, adding an extra layer of uncertainty to an already intricate web of challenges. As we move closer to October, the intricate dance between economic realities and political ambitions will undoubtedly shape the course ahead.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Over the weekend, the Ministry of Economy unveiled a comprehensive action plan set to roll out on Monday. The detailed 10-point roadmap casts a spotlight on a pivotal endeavor: the crafting of the 2024 Budget Bill with a resolute aim - the elimination of the primary fiscal deficit. A striking feature of the plan is the prospect of granting firms that employ their own dollar resources for import financing a noteworthy exemption - an escape from the clutches of the &quot;Impuesto Pais&quot; (Country Tax), VAT, and statistical tax. Notably, the plan also extends the reach of the &quot;Precios Justos&quot; (Fair Prices) Program agreements, reinforcing the government's commitment to maintaining equilibrium in essential commodity pricing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A focal point of the strategy involves the audacious bid to whittle down the primary fiscal deficit to 0% of GDP in 2024. A substantial share of these fiscal adjustments is expected to zero in on the realm of &quot;tax expenditures&quot;. These encompass a gamut of exemptions afforded to diverse sectors, collectively accounting for a notable 4.5% of GDP. Navigating these fiscal waters is paramount to realizing the proposed fiscal vision of a pristine zero primary deficit by 2024. Notably, among the exemptions tethered to promotional frameworks, the polarizing economic promotion regime of Tierra del Fuego looms large, boasting a hefty tax waiver tallying a staggering ARS220bn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Beyond the fiscal realm, the proposed agenda charts an array of endeavors. Among them, the launch of the Lithium Export Program, and the beckoning bids for the Northern Reversal Gas Pipeline. This strategic maneuver seeks to facilitate gas exports while enabling imports from Bolivia, redefining energy dynamics. Also, the inking of contracts with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the World Bank for US$500mn, financial injections that are poised to catalyze initiatives that bolster the knowledge economy. On prices, as the week unfolds, the Ministry of Commerce is poised to convene companies already participating in the &quot;Precios Justos&quot; Program. Their rendezvous will unveil the contours of forthcoming voluntary agreem ents, igniting discussions that are poised to reshape the econom ic trajectory.</span></p>
