We believe there is still an opportunity to benefit from the 'rate of change' related to the energy transition but look to '24 for further evidence of our 'rate of change<sup>1</sup> framework materializing. In terms of technology, we are optimistic on the progress of CCUS (see here), long duration energy storage (see here), and Generative Al (see here). We provide our preferred List of OW-rated energy transition plays in Exhibit 2 .</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we think about climate adaptation and resilience? 2023 was the warmest year on record, with land and sea surface temperatures reaching record highs. We believe climate adaptation and resilience will be a core focus area for investors as the risk of weather extremes continues to rise, and see opportunities in climate adaptation and resilience solutions. We provide a List OW-rated stocks exposed to climate adaptation and resilience in Exhibit 3.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will carbon markets reflect the current pace of decarbonization? Major compliance markets and voluntary carbon markets (VCM) were oversupplied in 2023 and price action reflects both 1) Lower demand due to lower emissions in Europe and the UK and 2) a significant sentiment shift on the authenticity of carbon neutral claims in the VCM. Global emissions rose in 2023, however, and Limiting temperature to 1.5C is nearly scientifically unattainable. ALL else equal, higher emissions should translate to a higher cost of carbon, but the market is presently disconnected because of 1) where the emissions are currently being taxed and 2) a pullback from corporates to offset their residual emissions. In 2024, we think compliance markets will continue to reflect regional trends rather than global as we are still years from sufficient implementation of carbon pricing in markets in which emissions are rising and border taxes to combat Leakage. On the voluntary side, we think the market will continue to be oversupplied not because of a lack of emissions to offset but because of continued tepid desire to use carbon-reducing credits against real emissions. That said, we expect to see greatest interest in carbon removal technologies (e.g., DAC, CCS, BECCS, and afforestation/reforestation) and in programs such as the ICVCM, and are most constructive on price action in these markets.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will growing inequality and interest in longevity influence the rise in social investing? Growing global population and resulting trends provide opportunities for corporates to address social needs. This is why we continue to believe the investment opportunity for social will grow. We see investment opportunities in our global &quot;culture club&quot; plays (see Exhibit 4). We also highlight 5 core themes in social investing we expect to get increased attention in coming months &amp;&nbsp;years, namely Access to Healthcare, Nutrition &amp;&nbsp;Fitness, Social Infrastructure, Access to Finance and Education/Reskilling.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's next for Al &amp;&nbsp;ESG and where are the opportunities? We expect the pace of innovation to continue to move rapidly, and think key focus areas for investors will be how Al will impact environmental and social goals. In our view, we see underappreciated opportunities in the intersection of Al and climate change, power demand/consumption in data centers, healthcare, farming, and education through reskilling/upskilling of the workforce. We also expect continued interest in Al risks specifically Al regulation, Al- Labor related impact, and the operationalization of</span></p></li></ul>
