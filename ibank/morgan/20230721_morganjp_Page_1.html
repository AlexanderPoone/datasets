<p><span class="font6">Two things are required for a soft landing. The first is disinflation. The second is continued economic expansion. Last week brought more evidence that, though very far from being complete, disinflation is ongoing through June. This week’s data flow confirmed that the economy continued moving forward last quarter and has enough momentum to continue expanding this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We expect to see this reflected in next week’s first reading on 2Q real GDP, which we believe expanded at a 2.0% annual rate. While we don’t have any hard data on 3Q GDP, recent developments suggest upside risks to our projected deceleration to a 0.5% pace of expansion. More generally, while we continue to look for a modest contraction to take hold beginning later this year, the prospect is growing that the economy may skirt a downturn altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The most important indicator this week informing our view of the pace of growth was the June retail sales report. While the 0.2% increase in total sales was nothing special, in the details of the report the core “control” sales category increased a more respectable 0.6%. Along with some upward revisions to prior months this suggests real consumer spending increased at around a 1.4% pace last quarter; while this would be a step down from the 4.2% increase in IQ, it is still consistent with an economy comfortably expanding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Away from the consumer, the data this week were more mixed. Industrial production in the manufacturing sector slipped 0.3% last month, the second consecutive decline. Stepping back, away from the motor vehicle sector, manufacturing activity has been flat to slightly down over the last year. The vehicle sector, on the other hand, has continued to recover from the unique issues afflicting that industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The June housing reports released this week were also a little on the light side. Some of that reflected expected payback from an unusually strong month for homebuilding in May. Bigger picture, housing starts in 2Q were down 16% from their recent peak in 1Q22, though still above any quarter from 3Q07 to 1Q20. Home resales in 2Q were down 35% from their recent peak in 4Q20 and are still </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">below</span><span class="font6"> any quarter from</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">2Q11 to 4Q22. The resilience of housing supply in the face of weak housing demand could, over time, alleviate the shortage of housing units.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally, the weekly jobless claims number eased down to 228,000—the lower end of the range that has prevailed since February—hinting at stability in the strong labor market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">It’s against this backdrop that the FOMC meets next week. We and the markets think a 25bp hike is a very likely outcome. Besides that, we don’t expect much else, and look for the statement to maintain the same hawkish bias as the one released after the June meeting. There are four red-letter days that will determine whether next week’s hike is the last of the cycle: the July and August payroll and CPI reports. We think they’ll collectively continue moving in the right direction to allow the Fed to stay on hold after next week, but time will tell.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Retailers end 1H on a high</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">As mentioned above, nominal retail spending increased 0.2% last month. Some of this subdued outcome was the result of declining gasoline prices. Moreover, the reported increase in nominal auto sales was lower than what would have been expected given the already-reported unit sales from the automakers. Away from these two categories (and building material and food service sales), the core “control” category registered a decent 0.6% last month, and for the quarter saw sales in this segment rise at a 2.1% annual rate (Figure 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">After inflation, nominal spending growth of 2.1% won’t deliver much real spending growth. Retail sales, however, capture little of what consumers spend on services, and services spending has powered the bulk of consumer spending growth over the past year. We expect that will be the case again in 2Q when we get the details of last quarter’s GDP report.</span></p>
