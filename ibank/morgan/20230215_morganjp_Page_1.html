<p><span class="font6">A year ago, we argued it was inappropriate to accept the widely held view expressed by central banks that the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">inflation process</span><span class="font6"> would remained anchored by the credibility of their medium-term commitments. Confidence in the inflation process did indeed erode in the face of a broadening inflation surge last year, despite well anchored medium-term expectations. This erosion in faith helps explain the dramatic acceleration in the pace of policy tightening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We believe faith in another pillar underlying central bank thinking is on track to erode this year: the notion that DM neutral real policy rates stand close to zero (Figure 1). Identifying a “neutral” rate is important as central banks consider how far they continue in the policy adjustment process currently underway. DM central banks appear to be looking for a position whereby holding policy rates at an appropriate level above neutral - a high-for-long stance - can be anticipated to gradually ease labor market tightness and lower inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The case for implementing this high-for-long strategy at levels close to current rates is, perhaps ironically, linked to the failure of the low-for-long strategy in the aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC). Faced with effective lower bound constraints and high unemployment rates, central banks committed to maintaining a perceived highly accom-modative stance for some time based on their expectation that it would gradually deliver reflation. In the event, labor mar-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">kets healed more slowly than anticipated and inflation remain depressed, an outcome which resulted in a dramatic drop in estimates of underlying neutral policy stances. For most central banks neutral real rates are currently viewed to be close to zero, levels significantly lower than estimates before the GFC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We attribute the ineffectiveness of last decade’s low-for-long stances to powerful disinflationary forces unleashed by the GFC outside the control of central banks. Importantly, conditions have changed dramatically. In contrast to last decade’s post-GFC balance sheet adjustment and regulator tightening, the pandemic and has improved private sector balance sheets and created pent-up demand. In addition, fiscal policy shocks during this cycle have generally been positive thus far, a radically different backdrop to the aggressive European and US tightening through the first half of the last expansion. Finally, the supply shocks related to the pandemic have altered the inflation process in a way that is likely raising short-term inflation risk premia. In all, these developments suggest that neutral policy rates have moved higher from estimates at the end of the last expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Whether this change is reflected in central bank behavior depends on the impact of last year’s disruptive shift in monetary policy stances. Over short horizons, changes in policy stances have an effect independent of the levels of rates. DM policy rates have risen by nearly 400bp over the past year, the largest increase in over forty years. To the extent that this shift tips the US or global economy into recession, any changes in the underlying level of neutral policy rates will be obscured for some time. If instead DM economies prove resilient in the face of this dramatic tightening, resilience and sticky inflation would reinforce the assessment that neutral rates have gone up. Absent a slide into recession this year, rising estimates of neutral rates are thus likely to play a role in policy decisions by DM central banks.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>

<p><span class="font6">A neutral policy rate is a relatively straightforward concept -the policy rate which stabilizes utilization rates. Containing elevated inflation generally requires a restrictive policy stance that lowers utilization rates, an effort which DM central banks are now undertaking. Last decade, lifting inflation required an accommodative stance in which policy rates were set below neutral. Over long periods of time, maintaining a neutral policy stance should be consistent with inflation targets for credible central banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Translating this concept into a practical tool is not easy. There are multiple near-term influences altering both the monetary transmission mechanism and the relationship between growth and utilization rates; these obscure estimation of neutral.</span></p>
