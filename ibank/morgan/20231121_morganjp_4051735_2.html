<p><span class="font3">Overview: delayed pain</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Soft landing views globally have been gaining traction as inflation slows, with the absence of clear signs of a slide into recession. Europe is closer than most to falling into recession, but we think this outcome will be avoided. Real income growth remains strong in the UK, business confidence is running high, there is a good chance of further fiscal easing over the coming six months, ahead of aprobable 2H24 election, and the near term global growth backdrop will likely be supportive for the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">For these reasons we think the UK will enjoy one last hurrah as consumption growth accelerates into early next year. But as these impulses fade and the lagged impact of past policy tightening builds, we expect a recession to occur by the end of the year. The timing and likelihood of such an event is highly uncertain. And increasing momentum behind the global soft landing narrative cannot be ignored for a small open economy such as the UK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nevertheless, our bias is that the UK will need a recession at some point to fully control inflation. We see the UK as having the highest probability of the “boiling the frog” scenario </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">described </span><span class="font4">by our global team. The UK has significant structural weaknesses that we expect will prolong its inflation problem despite weak demand. Inflation has fallen quickly from its double digit peak, but the journey from 5% all the way back down to 2% will be the hardest. We think the BoE will find it difficult to justify an easing in 1H24 if growth performs as we expect and underlying inflation pressures remain sticky.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We expect 50bps of easing late in 2024, but only after GDP has started to contract and the unemployment rate is on a journey that looks set to eventually take it to 5%. We do not expect the election outcome itself to have a material immediate impact on policy. Whoever wins is likely to be cautious, and particularly so if the UK’s structural problems eat into the government’s fiscal headroom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">One last hurrah for growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This year there has been a sharp divergence in confidence, with consumers still feeling gloomy as businesses remain relatively optimistic (Figure 1). The latter is another sign of the resilience that has seen labour markets remain reasonably tight and prevent the economy from tipping into recession. Pricing power has also helped to protect business profit margins. But the formerappears related to the adverse impact of high inflation on real incomes, and the disproportionate impact this tends to have on household sentiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Domestic demand has been weak this year, with </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">households raising their saving rate </span><span class="font4">to bank the gains from recently improving real incomes. As inflation falls further however household real income growth should remain firm on average and we would expect consumer confidence to improve. As this happens, we would expect households to spend more of their real income gains, preventing the savings rate from rising much further, and enabling consumption growth to provide a stronger contribution to growth into early 2024 (Figure 2).</span></p>
