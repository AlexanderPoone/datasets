<p><span class="font2">The US is the dominant factor for Asia local markets: 2023 saw a stronger USD and higher UST yields. But most of the market move materialised in 2H23, which was in contrast to what happened in 1H23 with China's reopening in 1Q23 and the regional banking crisis in 2Q23. This tells us that it is very difficult to get the view right for the whole year in a sell-side outlook.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">What we got right and wrong in 2023 on China: We were right about the reopening trade in October 2022, which ran through 1Q23. Although we predicted the slowdown in China growth in 2H23, we were surprised by how quickly growth started to lose momentum in 2Q23. The change of our constructive view on CNY was a bit Late but we turned more cautious on CNY in early May. We turned bullish on CNY in early July with the expectation of more PBOC intervention. In September, we switched to a more cautious stance again, which hasn't played out yet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What we got right and wrong in 2023 on the rest of Asia: In the broad market in Asia, the spillover effect from China reopening and the expectation of a tourism recovery boosted some of the high-beta Asia FX such as KRW and THB early in the year. We were right in turning bearish on Asia FX and duration in September but the rally in UST and USD depreciation in early November led us to hit stops on a number of trades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Threading the needle: At the same juncture as we did last year, when we laid out three themes for 2023, we felt that this year's outlook was a bit tough to write. According to our cross-asset strategists, many assets are already fairly priced for the benign environment our economists have forecast - slowing growth, falling inflation and eventually easier policy. Hence, writing an outlook at the end of 2023 for 2024 is like threading the needle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe that there are three themes as we head into 2024:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sub-par China recovery not translating into immediate CNY weakness;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long carry in Asia FX;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Add bullish duration trades selectively.</span></p>
