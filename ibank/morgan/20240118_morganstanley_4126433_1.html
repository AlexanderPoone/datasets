<div>
<p><span class="font7">Positions of Active Long-Only Asia/EM Managers</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We publish our first Asia/EM positioning guide to summarize allocation changes on stock, country and sector level overtime from a regional perspective. On top of that, we also share the distribution of active weights and compare allocation difference between US and EU managers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Key Takeaways</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Active fund outflow of GEM equity funds accelerated in 2H23, whilst Passive funds also recorded net outflows. &quot;Dollar Trade&quot; was the main theme driving these.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GEM active managers prefer India, Brazil and Mexico, while most underweight China, Saudi Arabia and Taiwan.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On industry group level, active managers prefer Semiconductors and Staples, while they underweight Materials, Tech Hardware and Automobiles &amp;&nbsp;Components.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout 2023, Tencent, Samsung and TSMC led the weight additions, while JD.com, Yum China and Reliance Industries were cut the most on stock Level.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Japan, global active managers were buying into Materials, Tech Hardware, and Utilities, but selling down on Energy, Transportation, and Automobiles.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Focus of The Month - China UW:</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to our bottom-up fund position analysis by tracking the Largest 80 EM active Long-only mutual funds (with average fund AUM at US$3.9bn), the dominated rebalancing activities among these managers in 2H2O23 were to rotate out of China, Taiwan and Korea, and add toward Brazil and Mexico, (Exhibit 5). On sector Level, they added Financials but trimmed Info Tech ( Exhibit 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Underweight China is almost a consensus position among EM active long-only funds, with the average underweight estimated to be 3.2%. In terms of distribution, 70 out of the 80 EM funds we track are either equal-weight or underweight China (Exhibit 1). For the remaining 10 EM funds, if they also turn equal-weight on China, it would imply an outflow of US$1.1bn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We also note that there is a meaningful market preference discrepancy between US and EU managers - US managers prefer India over Korea and Taiwan, while EU managers are more neutral among the three countries ( Exhibit 2).</span></p>
