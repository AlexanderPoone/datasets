<div>
<p><span class="font3">Sinopharm was established in 2003 and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in China with an approximately 18.4% market share. The company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Sept. 2009. Sinopharm's major chunk of revenue comes from pharmaceutical distribution, but it has also started operating its own flagship retail pharmacies and it also involved in production and sale of pharmaceutical and related products. The largest shareholder is Fosun Investment, which is also a major pharmaceutical manufacturer based in Shanghai.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Sinopharm Pharm primarily generates revenue through pharmaceutical distribution. It’s the largest pharmaceutical distributor in China with approximately an 18.4% market share and it has grown significantly from 18.4%, 18.1 % in 2015 and 2014. It has maintained its market leading position for over 5 years and we believe its market share will reach 25% by 2020. Also, as the distribution industry develops and becomes more similar to the developed world economies where Top 5 players enjoy 60-80% market share as opposed to 40% in China, the market leaders should have significant upside as the industry grows and Chinese government implements more stringent regulatory policies which will eventually phase out the smaller players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking forward, Sinopharm aims to transform itself into an integrated wholesale pharmaceutical distributor. Over the years Sinopharm’s growth has outpaced the industry growth by 3-5% and we expect this margin advantage to continue over the next years. We see continuous margin expansion with 1) its fast expansion of retail pharmacies business as retail pharmacies carries higher GM (40%) and NM (10%) vs. Sinopharm distribution GM (8%) and NM (2%); 2) improving operational leverage; 3) lowering financial cost. Furthermore, we see further upside from new initiatives, including e-commerce pharmaceutical sales, which currently generate sales of over Rmb500mn, and financial leasing business.</span></p>
