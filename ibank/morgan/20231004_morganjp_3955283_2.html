<p><span class="font2">Financing needs inch higher</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Gross external financing needs (GXFN) are generally expected to move higher in 2024 for the Edge economies compared to this year. The median increase is by about 0.4% of GDP (Figure 2, 1.3% ex. GCC). Larger CA deficits, or smaller surpluses drive much of the increase. Private and public debt maturities are in line with last year, with the exception of external bonded debt, wliich stepsup slightly.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The average CA deficit would inch wider for commodity importers as a fonction of higher oil prices next year (Figure 4). Our commodities team forecasts Brent crude prices next year averaging about $83 bbl compared to $81 bbl this year. In the past, we’ve found that a $10 bbl move up (ordown) translates to </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">0.7% of GDP widening (or narrowing) in CA deficits for commodity importers</span><span class="font3">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">The change in CA balance for commodity exporters varies widely depending on their net import export mix. Oil prices at $83 bbl would guarantee a comfortable CA surplus in the GCC. Some downside risks are linked to oil production, largely dependent on OPEC+ decisions. We’ve pencilled in a moderate recoveiy in production as Saudi Arabia is gradually phasing out the ongoing Imbpd curb.</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">Outside of the GCC, CA balances would improve only in Kazakhstan, Paraguay, Uruguay, Angola, and Nigeria. In Kazakhstan and Nigeria improvements are driven by both prices and production. In addition, Kazakhstan’s CA deficit</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font3">would narrow on lower capital imports. Because of unrecorded exports, errors and omissions are larger than the CA balance this year and will likely remain large in 2024; when assessed together, the CA and errors balance is expected to remain in surplus, but weaken from 2023. Improved agriculture output following the prolonged drought would more than offset higher foel imports in Uruguay and Paraguay. CA deficits would worsen in Zambia, Mongolia, and Uzbekistan as they are also net importer of fuel. Ecuador’s swing from a CA surplus of 0.5% of GDP in 2023 to a 0.5% of GDP deficit in 2024 rests on continued fiscal slippage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Russia boost to neighbors starts to fade</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Countries neighboring Russia had seen a significant improvement in their CA balances as well as financial flows last year and, to a lower extent, this year. Within the CA, remittances flows increased sharply (in Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Georgia, and Armenia), as did (re)exports to Russia for Eurasian Economic Union members, which in many cases go unrecorded and appear as large and positive errors. These countries act as transit countries for imports from Western and Asian countlies and earn a margin on this type of trade. They also gained inflows of financial fonds from Russian individuals and companies last year mostly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">These Russia-linked boosts have faded this year and the trend should continue. Remittances have returned to pre-war levels in Georgia and Uzbekistan. The margin obtained from re-exports to Russia is also shrinking with fewer benefits going forward. Also, financial flows have declined and there is even a risk of outflows as individuals or companies relocate. One saving grace is that most countries have built large buffers and can accommodate outflows. However, there was no reserves build-up in Uzbekistan and reversal of these factors along with expansionary fiscal policies and softer IFI inflows have already put FX reserves underpressure. The trend might continue in 2024 unless policies reverse and IFI inflows recover.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Modest portfolio funding amid higher rates</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As GXFN would increase next year, Edge economies would face the choice of raising more sources or leaning on reserves. In general, our scenarios assume that Edge economies access enough sources to cover higher needs. Yet reflecting high long-term borrowing costs for many Edge issuers (as US rates have increased more than spreads have tightened), we assume Eurobond issuance for only a few countries. The cast is concentrated in countries rated BB or higher, and in most cases, is intended to refinance upcoming maturities (Figure 5). Outside of GCC, Eurobonds would provide net new financing in a handful cases. For now, rising global yields mostly imply higher funding costs for this set.</span></p>
