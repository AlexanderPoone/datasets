<p><span class="font4">CVS Shift to VBC with SGFY Acquisition</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">This evening, CVS announced the acquisition of Signify Health (SGFY) covered by Amie Samuel. This was well telegraphed in the market over the past few weeks with the only unknowns being timing and price. CVS will acquire all outstanding shares of SGFY at $30.50 per share, roughly $8B. This equates to 25.7x 2023E EBITDA. CVS will finance the acquisition with existing cash on hand and available resources. In our opinion this brings CVS closer to their goal of managing more lives through value based care (VBC) relationships. With 2.5M unique patient visits in home and virtually we believe SGFY brings incremental opportunities for CVS to manage the patient for optimal outcomes. With a network of virtual and in-person options CVS has the opportunity to truly bend the cost curve in a value based care environment, thus creating a win/win/win environment for the patient/payor/CVS. We remain positive on shares of CVS as we believe they are uniquely positioned as we continue to shift towards VBC with cost/quality/convenience as the pillars in a VBC/Consumer environment.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerating VBC with SGFY acquisition. </span><span class="font7">The market continues to shift towards VBC and with the SGFY acquisition CVS will have the opportunity to influence more lives. Today, SGFY senses roughly 2.5M unique patient visits. With over 9K CVS locations the company has the opportunity to close gaps in care and lower healthcare costs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SGFY expected to be accretive to 2024 EPS. </span><span class="font7">We project that SGFY will be roughly 1.5% accretive to 2024 EBITDA with $3 37M of EBITDA (per Anne Samuel). We believe this should contribute to CVS’s 2025 goals as discussed at their 2021 Analyst Day of mid-single-digit growth via acquisitions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What capabilities does SGFY add to CVS? </span><span class="font7">Through its Home &amp;&nbsp;Community Sendees business, Signify has access to the homes of roughly ~80M members emolled in Medicare Advantage and Medicaid Managed care. This business has been growing nicely, at a 29% CAGR over the past 3 years, and while Signify is the largest independent provider of in-home evaluations, it still holds &lt;5% market share. Managed Care companies serve as both SGFY’s largest customers and competitors, but the trend to outsourcing has served as a growth driver for the company. It is worth noting that the company’s largest customers are Humana, Aetna, and Optum which generate 26%, 24%, and 11% of revenue, respectively. We see risk to SGFY’s revenue stream from competitors if the company is no longer independent. However, we note this was a concern when CVS acquired Caremark and to date Caremark is the largest PBM to other managed care plans. Signify identifies high priority individuals and deploys providers to perform in-home evaluations by clinicians which aid in the code capture needed for Medicare Advantage (MA) risk scoring and help the patient’s primary care physician manage care. During these evaluations, SGFY creates a comprehensive record of the clinical, social, and behavioral needs of the patient to enable their healthcare providers to better engage with them and fill gaps in care. The company has an extensive provider network of 9,000 providers (doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) and 200 clinical &amp;&nbsp;social care</span></p>
