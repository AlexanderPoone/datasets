<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Direct beneficiary of China’s booming box office</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7">Box office in China has surged from RMBlObn in 2010 to RMB44bn in 2015 at a CAGR of 34%, and the momentum is showing no signs of losing steam. It is driven by: 1) fast increase in theatres and screens; 2) improvement in quality of Chinese language films; 3) rising disposable income and entertainment spending; and 4) convenience of online ticket purchase, etc. Theatre companies have continued to aggressively roll out new screens to ride on the burgeoning industry growth. Number of theatres has increased from 2,000 in 2010 to 6,494 in 2015 at a CAGR of 27%, alongside a 38% increase in no. of screens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">We think IMAX China is a good play on China's box office story as it directly benefits from:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued strong installation momentum: </span><span class="font7">We see two drivel's for continued strong demand for IMAX theatre systems: 1) The booming film market in China has enticed companies to aggressively open new theatres; and 2) growing consumer demand for high-quality and immersive watching experience has led to strong demand for non-conventional theatre screens, including IMAX, which is the leading non-conventional theatre screen brand in China. The number of IMAX screen installations has accelerated, from 42 in 2013 to 64 in 2014 and 74 in 2015, and is expected to jump to 100 screens in 2016 by the company.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing box office sharing: </span><span class="font7">IMAX takes a substantial share of IMAX foimat films’ box office revenue through two ways: 1) taking 8-16% of box office revenue from theatres under the revenue-sharing an'angements in the theatre business; and 2) taking 9.5%-12.5% from film studios in the film business. With a growing IMAX theatre network and overall favorable market reception to IMAX foimat films, the box office-related revenue has grown at a CAGR of 52% in the past three years and we are expecting 41% growth in the coming three yearn.</span></p>
