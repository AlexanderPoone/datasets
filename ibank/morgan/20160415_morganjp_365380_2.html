<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>We expect a refocus on the core, along with a favorable macro backdrop, to drive a re-rating</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">We factor in the latest results and guidance, revising FYI 6E-17E earnings for CRG and CRCC by 1-2%. FYI5 results, though only meeting expectations on the bottom line, saw shaip improvements in cash flow and the balance sheet on easing hi tiding conditions and the payoff of recent efforts, with restructuring and a refocusing on cash construction. These were positive surprises, given that cash blockage and overleveraged balance sheets were prior key concents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Looking ahead, we expect earnings growth to accelerate further on revived revenue growth and continued improving profitability. These new operational trends, along with favorable macro conditions, if sustained, may drive a re-rating, in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">CRG and CRCC have risen 12% and 9% since beginning of the year, respectively, outperfonning the HSCEI Index (down 5% during the period). However, this rebound was from a low base, and both stocks still trade at undemanding valuation multiples of an 8-9x P/E and 0.8-0.9x P B on FY16E despite solid growth prospects and ROE generation. Both stocks slid shaiply during 2015 on concerns over slowing infra FAI growth as a result of funding constraints; CRG and CRCC fell c65% on average from the recent peak last April to the recent trough in early February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We reset our Dec-16 DCF-based PTs, factoring in earnings revisions, changes to capex and working capital turns and recent fundraising, among other adjustments. Maintain OW on CRG-H and CRCC-H.</span></p>
