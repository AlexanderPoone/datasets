<p><span class="font4">10-year yields has outstripped the move in fundamentals, leaving yields 22bp higher than our fair value model. However, we are cognizant that the technical forces driving yields higher over the past few weeks may not yet be behind us. While prior government shutdowns have been followed by declines in yields, we have argued that the current episode could in fact be bearish for Treasuries, given the acute concerns over fiscal deficits and Treasury supply. Additionally, investor positioning in duration remains on the longer end of ranges observed over the last decade. Moreover, with QT ongoing, and foreign official demand for Treasuries likely to wane further, alongside declining FX reserve balances, we have argued that term premium is likely to rise, making it challenging for yields to decline even as the Fed goeson hold (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">In the c ye of th c beholder,</span><span class="font4"> J.

<p><span class="font4">Adding to the technical pressures, the relentless selloff and long-end steepening in recent weeks has made delivery options in bond futures valuable and interesting, and the prospect of shifts in the cheapest-to-deliverbond has drawn considerable interestfrom marketparticipants this week. Treasury futures contracts are physically settled, with shorts ultimately required to make delivery of one oftlieeligible bonds in thedelivery month. For the Decemberbond futures contract (the &quot;USZ3&quot; contract), bonds ranging from the 3.5% Feb ’39 to the 3% Feb ’49 are eligible for delivery; however, one of these bonds is usually cheapest to deliver, and this CTD bond tends to drive the duration characteristics and pricing of the contract. CTDs can change as yields and curve change - in particular, a sustained rise in yields in the 15- to 25-year sector of the curve, and/or a steepening of that part of the curve, can cause longer maturity bonds to eventually cheapen enough to become more optimal to deliver, causing the CTD to shift longer and potentially causing a further extension in the duration of theUSZ3 contract. For much of the USZ3 contract’s life, the 4.5% Aug'39 has been cheapest to deliver, but the CTD shifted this week to the 4.625% of Feb ’40 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Figu re 2), </span><span class="font4">suggesting that the real money community was delivered duration in this week’s selloff. The relentless rise inyields has in fact raised the oddsofmore material shifts to longer-matu-rity bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Away from bond futures, swap spreads narrowed across the curve this week, while implied volatility rose alongside the rise in rates. Looking ahead, we now recommend unwinding</span></p>
