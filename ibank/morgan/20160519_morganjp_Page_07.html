<p><span class="font5">Wanda Cinema Line is IMAX China’s largest single customer. Twenty-nine out of the 75 IMAX installations in 2015 and 50 out of the 100 expected installations in 2016 are in partnership with Wanda under the full revenue-sharing arrangement. 30% and 34% of IMAX China’s revenue and gross profit, respectively, in 2015 were directly contributed by Wanda in the theatre business; and the company also indirectly generates revenue from Wanda in its films business. The strong relationship with Wanda and Wanda’s aggressive theatre build plans are widely considered to be a key driver that underpins IMAX China’s robust growth in the PRC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Wanda earlier had a commitment for 120 installations through 2020 and excluding the c50 confirmed installations this year, only cl3 committed installations are left. We see a high likelihood for Wanda to continue to make new orders beyond its earlier commitment. However, any unfavorable changes in terms, such as a reduced revenue-sharing percentage or a shorter-term revenue sharing, will adversely impact IMAX China’s financials. Softer demand, possibly due to a slowdown in new theatre openings or Wanda’s shift toward other non-conventional screen brands, will also likely lead to a slowdown in IMAX China’s growth momentum.</span></p>
