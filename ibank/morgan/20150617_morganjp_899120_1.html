<h6><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Beer volume seeing growth in 1Q; Focus on revised proposal from parent for non-beer business</span></h6>
<p><span class="font0">CRE announced its 1Q15 results with total revenue of Rmb48,616mn, up 16% y/y, and recurring net profit of Rmb360mn, up 3% y/y, vs the net loss estimate we have for 1H15 as the retail business was profitable in IQ 15. The retail business posted an underlying profit of HKD314mn in 1Q15, while we had been expecting retail to be loss-making for 1H15. While we still believe retail will turn into losses in 2Q, as CRE’s existing retail business has major seasonality with earnings all front-loaded in IQ (CRE ex-Tesco 1Q14 retail earnings were at HKD364mn vs remaining Apr-Dec 14 which posted a HKDl,217mn loss), it was surprising to see Tesco losses narrowing from a HKD906mn loss for the seven months ending Dec-14 to only a HKD79mn loss in IQ 15. The beer business delivered 8% revenue growth in 1Q15 (vs Tsingtao’s -3% revenue decline in the same quarter) and 750% earnings growth. The top line was largely in line with our 1H estimate of 8%, while the bottom line was up significantly, as last year was a low base impacted by incorporating Kingway’s losses. Management noted in the announcement that while the overall beer industry recorded a decline in volume during 1Q15, CRE returned to growth momentum thanks to the enhanced production capacity, improved and expanded sales distribution channels and marketing promotions, which boosted the sales volume of mid/high-end products to grow by 30% during the quarter. We expect CRE Beer to post 7% sales growth in FY15E (driven by c3% volume growth and 4% ASP growth) and c20% earnings growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CRE noted that they have received a revised proposal from the parent, CRH: </span><span class="font0">On April 13th CRE announced that its parent, CRH, is proposing to buy all the non-beer business from CRE. Therefore, we believe all eyes are mostly on the beer business and the revised proposal that is expected to be published soon. In the original announcement related to the disposal, CRE noted that its parent CRH is proposing to buy all the non-beer business from CRE for a total consideration of HKD28bn. Along with this, it is proposed that CRE will distribute almost the entire disposal gains as special dividends to shareholders (corresponds to HKD11.5 per share). This would be conditional upon a capital reduction. And once the above is completed, CRH would be willing to make an offer for up to 10% of CRE's outstanding shares at a price of HKD 12.7 per share. CRE announced that on June 15th, they received a revised binding proposal from the parent CRH and CRE’s board has approved the proposal. Management notes more details will be released jointly with CRH as soon as practicable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Retail posted profit in IQ: </span><span class="font0">CRE posted a HKD360mn net profit for the retail business in 1Q15. Excluding the Tesco loss, CRE’s retail business earnings were down cl4% y/y. Retail earnings turned to profit as the Tesco loss was relatively small in IQ at HKD79mn. While we still believe the overall retail business will turn into loss in 2Q as CRE's existing retail business has a major seasonality with earnings all front-loaded in IQ (CRE ex-Tesco IQ 14 retail earnings were HKD364mn vs remaining Apr-Dec 14 posted HKDl,217mn loss), it was surprising to see Tesco losses narrowing from a HKD906mn loss for the seven months ending Dec-14 to only a HKD79mn loss in 1Q15. CRE’s retail division recorded a SSS decline of 3.3% in 1Q15 y/y given the slowdown in the economy, as per management. Management believes accelerated development in e-commerce will continue to negatively impact traditional retailers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Food business reported a net loss of Rmb38mn in 1Q15 due to the continuing transition. </span><span class="font0">While its rice business has expanded rapidly through M&amp;A, significant initial investments and marketing expenses continued to drag profitability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Beverage growth was driven by water. </span><span class="font0">The beverage division reported 560% earnings growth in 1Q15, driven by 9.3% volume growth in 1Q15 which can be attributable to growth in bottled water, which now</span></p>
