<p><span class="font2">making an online purchase on Temu (owned by PDD Holdings, PDD.O, covered by Eddy Wang); while survey and app download data point to a sharp early ramp, we see barriers preventing widespread disruption. Notably, our survey data showed cross-border platforms ranking below-average for product quality and delivery speeds, with only mixed perceptions on pricing. Particularly for MercadoLibre (MELLO), while we acknowledge the traction in survey data for Amazon Brazil and the uptake in downloads for Temu Mexico, we have conviction that MELI's marketplace scale leadership, logistics network, and financial services tie-ins combine for a sustainable competitive moat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our OW-rated stock calls center on digital platform leaders — MELI (Top Pick) for eCommerce, DESP for online travel — and on food retail discounters Assai / Carrefour Brasil/ Walmex. We broadly see our calls aligning with Morgan Stanley LatAm Equity Strategist Nikolaj Lippmann and team's bias toward secular growth across LatAm, and lower beta in Brazil. For </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">MELI,</span><span class="font2"> we see accelerated share gains from '23 further cementing MercadoLibre's leading marketplace position into '24 — with our global deep dive pointing to pricing power in areas such as advertising and logistics. We see multi-pronged profitability drivers, and look for '24E net margins +320bps y/y to 11.0%; we see the shares at 42x '24 P/E, for our outsized +80% 2O22-2O25E EPS CAGR. While for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Despegar</span><span class="font2"> (DESP.N), we see continued room to run for our August 2023 assumption of coverage thesis around secular plus cyclical support within LatAm online travel bookings; we Look for improved FCF conversion to further drive valuation support in '24. Within Food Retail, our Discounters: Growth Plus Resilience analysis illuminated discount food retail as one of the best-positioned retail formats globally, with growth through macro cycles plus resilience from the online threat. For Brazil cash &amp;&nbsp;carry operators </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Assai</span><span class="font2"> (ASAI3.SA) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Carrefour Brasil</span><span class="font2"> (CRFB3.SA), we look for '23 headwinds to turn to tailwinds for the year ahead, with a move past food deflation, sales/margin uplifts from converted stores, and financial expense relief amid lower interest rates. For </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Walmex </span><span class="font2">(WALMEX.MX), our comparative analysis with Femsa (FMX.N, covered by Ricardo Alves) supports our conviction in the company's earnings compounding and high return on capital model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We downgrade Magazine Luiza to Underweight, on durable goods caution and limited survey traction in newer categories. For department stores, amid diverging earnings revision trends we downgrade Falabella to Underweight, and upgrade Liverpool to Equal-weight. For </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Magazine Luiza</span><span class="font2"> (MGLU3.SA), we downgrade to UW as our survey data showed limited traction outside of core electronics/appliances, weighing on marketplace optionality. In a year where we expect a muted rebound for consumption — impacting sales of higher-ticket durable categories (i.e., appliances, electronics, furniture) — we see risk that Magalu's earnings recovery gets pushed out. With near-breakeven net income for 2024E and a 31x P/E multiple on our 2O25E earnings, we see limited valuation support. Within the department store channel for LatAm, we continue to see structural traffic and margin headwinds from the shift to online, while this thesis has been slow to play out particularly in Mexico. As diverging earnings trends have not been fully reflected in the stocks, we swap ratings — downgrading Chile-based </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Falabella</span><span class="font2"> (FALABELLA.SN) to Underweight and upgrading Mexico-based </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Liverpool </span><span class="font2">(LIVEPOLC1.MX) to Equal-weight.
