<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Longs build on EUR crosses: </span><span class="font2">The market may have cut Long EUR/USD positions rapidly on Friday on the back of the aforementioned catalysts, but we find investors<sup>1</sup> confidence to be long EUR on crosses has increased, particularly against GBP. ECB's signal for another 50bp hike in March - though not enough to meet the market's high bar - still contrasted with BoE commentary of a pause and more rate cuts further out. EUR/GBP longs built in Line with our expectations and though positioning there is starting to look extreme versus history, it is still below Levels seen post the September 2022 mini-budget (Exhibit 3). JPY shorts (against both EUR and USD) may be added too, as reports suggesting Amamiya as the next BoJ Governor may reduce market expectations for a sudden hawkish BoJ tilt. In contrast, we don't see scope for more EUR strength against NOK and SEK. Both crosses stand at multi-year highs, and the market is already meaningfully Long (Exhibit 2). Stronger-than-expected European (and global) growth should be supportive of small open economies, and the increasing probability of a soft landing could keep equities supported as the current earnings season draws to a close. We prefer being short EUR/NOK given the also solid domestic picture and higher beta to oil prices, while hedging the possibility of a risk pullback via Long EUR/AUD positions.</span></p>

For this week, the strategy's favours USD Longs against USD/CAD and USD/JPY (Exhibit 4). We agree more with the Long USD/JPY signal given pricing for Fed rate hikes may build (supporting US yields) amid strong data, contrasting BoJ pricing should a continuation candidate gets nominated as BoJ Governor. USD/CAD should be more well behaved given the lack of downward momentum this year and</span></p>
