<p><span class="font5">Late last week Fitch upgraded El Salvador's credit rating to CCC+ after briefly placing the country' on a selective default following what it considered to be an adverse exchange (from the creditor perspective) of domestic pension-related securities as per the approval of last year’s pension reform. However, upon the completion of the exchange, the agency announced the upgrade from an earlier CC rating to CCC+, acknowledging the swift improvement in fiscal accounts over the past couple of years and the payment of &quot;sizeable global bond amortizations earlier in the year&quot;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following the release of the IMF’s executive summary' of the Article IV consultation in El Salvador, we argued that the multilateral had been likely too conservative when it came to assessing the degree of improvement in El Salvador's Fiscal accounts, which saw a massive turnaround in the country's fiscal balance from a roughly 5.7% of GDP primary deficit to a surplus of just about 2% last year. As we had pointed out. the improvement reflected both spending restraint and strong growth in revenues, particularly tax revenues. Furthermore, it is worth noting that El Salvador has managed a prompter recovery in activity and. by some measures, has output back above its pre-pandemic trend. This not only aided tax collection, but also enhanced fiscal accounts by raising the denominator. We expect these two trends, above-potential growth and fiscal restraint, to hold in the short-term, and continue to expect a gradual decline in debt ratios, though, were growth to shift back to its potential rate, debt would then go on a mildly ascending trend, all else equal. This remains our base-case, as we think additional fiscal efforts to raise revenues will face increasing challenges going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fitch stnick a slightly more upbeat tone, suggesting fiscal metrics would get a boost from the recent pension debt restructuring that would allow the country to further consolidate fiscal accounts as pension-related spending decreased materially. We agree this is a source of upside to our roughly 2% primary surplus forecast, but think that as the election in 2024 approaches there is room for spending to become a bit looser.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As has been the case, though the fiscal turnaround has been massive (we think achieving somewhere around a 3% primary' surplus in equilibrium, growth and inflation-wise, would be enough to stabilize debt around its current levels 76-78% of GDP), El Salvador’s main issue remains one of funding, which is most evident in its external accounts. Last year’s financial account fell well short ofcoveringthe large 6.6% of GDP current account deficit, resulting in reserve drainage of roughly USS700 million. We think that the current account deficit will shrink noticeably this year on lower oil prices, but will still need to be met by multilateral loans, which as of now are the only source of reliable external financing. That said, year-to-date regional multilateral support has been forthcoming. Overall, we have grown more constructive on El Salvador’s macro picture, but still think there remain significant points of strain going forward. Fitch pointed out its low rating is partly reflective of some of these risks.</span></p>
