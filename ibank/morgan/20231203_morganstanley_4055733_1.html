<p><span class="font2">#1 Monzo upcoming potential fundraise. Further to numerous reports back in October that Monzo was considering selling a c.£300m stake, on 18th Nov Sky News reported that Capital G, a fund managed by Google, is considering injecting the new capital into the UK neobank. The funding round would reportedly raise £300-500m, which would value Monzo at &gt;£4bn vs its Latest £3.5bn valuation at which it raised £360m in capital from Abu Dhabi Growth Fund in Dec-21. According to sources quoted in the article, discussions have reached an advanced stage and Monzo is expecting to secure the funding by the end of the year. When we spoke to Monzo CEO TS Anil at our Annual TMT Conference, he shared that the company is on the path to IPO and expects to be ready in mid-2024, but that the decision around timing will be made depending on business planning and the market environment. We have previously looked in detail at the neobanks space in Europe in our notes Neobanks: Exploring disruptive potential (31 May 2022) and Neobanks: how does the path to profitability look? (20 Dec 2022).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">#3 Mastercard joins $65m funding round for Paysend. This week (29th Nov), IBSintelligence reported that International payments provider Paysend has secured the funding from Mastercard. Earlier this year Paysend revealed it had entered into a partnership with Mastercard to expand its cross-border payments offering for SMEs via its Open Payments Network (OPN). The OPN orchestrates payments from initiation to settlement and it is connected to a network of Local partners and instant payments schemes to facilitate close to real-time payments. The fundraise was announced alongside the announcement of Paysend's new strategic partnership with TelevisaUnivision. The company is targetting US-Latam currency corridors and the deal means it can market its offering for the next 3 years on TelevisaUnivlsion's network.</span></p>
