<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Gross Margin Expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue fell significantly from 56.3% in 2014 to 50.5% in 2015. Cost of sales also shrunk by 6.11% during this period. This led to an improvement in gross margin to 49.5% in 2015, up from 43.7% in 2014. This was primarily because the group disposed of the low margin pharmaceutical distribution and retail business. In 1H16, the costs increased by 10%, while they decreased by 8% during the same period last year. Further, due to increased focus on cost cutting through internal integration led to a decrease of 18% in procurement costs through centralized procurement. Gross margin improved by 3% to 53.5% in 1H16 on fast growing of high margin products which we believe will continue.</span></p>
