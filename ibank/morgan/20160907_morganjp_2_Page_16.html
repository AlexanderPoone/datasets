</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font3">SGA as a proportion of sales remained relatively stable at 4.3% in 2015 and 2014. In 1H16, SGA accounted for 4.0% of sales. We expect it to further decrease to 4.2% in 2016 and then stabilize at 4.1% in 2017 and 2018. The SGA expenses increase is attributable to the group’s enlarged operation scale, its business development and its expansion of distribution networks through new setups and acquisitions of companies and businesses. The decrease in the percentage as sales is expected to continue as Sinopharm implements cost control measures and enjoys economies of scale.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Operating margin increased from 3.9% in 2014 to 4.0% in 2015. As of 1H16, operating margin was 4.1% similar to 1H15. We expect the margins to further increase to 4.14% in 2016, 4.12% in 2017 and 4.16% in 2018. The main reason for improvement in operating margins is increased efficiency, economies of scale and increase in distribution network and hence revenues without significant increment in costs.</span></p>
