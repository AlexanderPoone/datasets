<h6><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Brief Background on System Integrators and Their Relation to Suppliers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font3">To provide context around the survey results, the sections below give a brief background on what a “control system integrator” is and how its work relates to the automation revenues of the key suppliers in our coverage.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Control System Integrators: What They Do</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What is a control system integrator?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Control system integrators are engineering firms specializing in bringing together component subsystems and providing a broader automation solution for the end user. A typical job would involve taking general requirements or specifications from a customer, then designing and executing the delivery of that specific manufacturing capability, including the required hardware, software, documentation, and installation. Approximately 40% of a typical system integrator’s revenue would be the pass-through of equipment purchased from a supplier, which is given a small mark-up, while a control system integrator’s “value add” is the engineering/service provided (typically represents -60% of revenue).</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Role in the sales channel</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As background, the primary channels for automation equipment include 1) direct sales to end users, 2) sales through distributors, and 3) various independent sales representatives, including integrators. Suppliers often prefer to use direct sales for large or captive accounts, while distributors may stock multiple brands or may be retained on an exclusive basis by a supplier for a certain region. System integrators are part of this third category of independent reps and are typically employed when applications are complex and products need specialized programming or design. Although there are a handful of larger players with $25-100mm in sales, there are thousands of system integrators globally, with most having revenues in the sub-$5 million range.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>A brief history on the development of systems integration</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Prior to the 1980s, instrumentation and control projects were typically handled by a combination of OEM representatives, electrical/mechanical contractors, large architecture and engineering (A&amp;E) firms, and internal engineers employed by the end user. The automation OEMs were generally accustomed to handling basic integration projects such as programming a system to interface with specific sensors or valves. As control technology developed through the 1980s/1990s, automation systems became both (a) more complex, and (b) increasingly “open” in the ability to combine components from various vendors into a customized system for the end user. This created a natural opportunity for highly advanced firms that could bring together the technology in a value-added way. Simultaneous to this was a trend toward consolidation in the industry, with end users reducing their internal engineering head count and increasingly relying on outside expertise. Therefore, it is not uncommon for a control system integrator to have worked for either an OEM supplier or an end user before moving to either join a firm or start his or her own company.</span></p>
