<p><span class="font8">Our latest proprietary system integrator survey reflects demand that is “cresting” at a high level with significantly higher impact from supply chain disruptions, not a surprise. Most integrators (83%) anticipate an increase in demand over the next 12 months, which is slightly lower than the Oct’21 survey (88%) but is a meaningful step up from the 2019/2020 survey of 64%/67%. Respondents saw -7% average revenue growth in the last 12 months and they expect -9% growth in the coming 12 months. Responses in this survey indicate -4% capex growth in ’22 as compared to 5% in the Oct’21 survey, while for ’23 capex, the growth expectation is stable at -4%. On April trends specifically, approximately 38% noted stronger demand than in Jan-Mar vs -19% indicating weaker demand (~51%/7% Apr’21), which is slightly worse than normal seasonality. Backlog commentary continues to be strong in a tight supply chain environment, not unusual, with 48% of respondents seeing stronger than normal backlog vs -50% in the Oct’21 survey. Specifically on supply chain disturbances, -98% of respondents indicated that these have a negative impact on their business (vs 94% in the Oct’21 survey) with 74% seeing a material impact, which is a significant step up from 57% in the Oct'21 survey. On pricing, respondents are seeing a -11% price increase on the products that they buy and they are passing on a ~7% price hike to their customers on average. Of the respondents, -77% highlighted that they are being charged by vendors with prices set on the day of order and -75% of respondents indicated that price increases are a limiting factor to growth in terms of customer budget. Approximately 74% of respondents said they are seeing project modifications due to inflationary pressures while -32% are seeing cancellations. Turning to software, MES adoption appears to be relatively slow as -31% of respondents indicated that MES adoption is minimal vs -20% in the Oct’21 survey.</span></p>

Morgan/CSIA automation survey. </span><span class="font8">This note summarizes our latest proprietary survey of control system integrators, where we received -230 responses. System integrators are third-party firms focusing on delivering technically advanced capital projects, a proxy for upward of 70% of sales for automation suppliers. Responses are slanted toward North America, similar to the overall SI industry, but with some global representation as well. We are pleased to continue our partnership with CSIA (Control System Integrators Association), the leading professional association representing the industry.</span></p>

<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survey results show demand cresting at a high level. </span><span class="font8">Responses on demand remained strong but the degree of positive responses has moved a bit lower given uncertainties in the macro environment. The overall percentage of those reporting order strength versus weakness was slightly lower at 51% vs our prior survey (58%/13% strength/weakness vs 63%/15% prior), with expectations for increased order activity over the next 6 months at ~60%/8% (strength/weakness) vs ~66%/5% in our prior survey. On April trends specifically, approximately 38% noted stronger demand than in Jan-Mar vs -19% indicating weaker (~51%/7% Apr’21), showing April is slightly worse seasonally on recovery. On B2B, -45% are &gt;1.0x and -16% are &lt;1.0x, compared to our Oct’21 survey, which showed -44% &gt;1.0x and -15% &lt;1.0x.</span></p></li></ul>
