<p><span class="font6">Developments this week kept alive hopes for a soft landing. Perhaps the most important news was the October PCE price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. Overall PCE prices were unchanged in October, taking the year-ago reading down to 3.0%. The closely-fol lowed ex-food and energy core PCE index barely increased 0.2% (0.16%) in October, taking the year-ago increase down to 3.5%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Core PCE inflation peaked at 5.6% in early 2022, and the conventional sacrifice ratio logic would have predicted that the subsequent 2.1%-pt decline would be accompanied by a substantial increase in the unemployment rate. Instead, the so-far immaculate disinflation is a testament to how much the ’21 -’22 inflation surge was driven by impaired supply that has since improved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">News on growth was more mixed this week, but suggests the economy is broadly cooling in 4Q. Looking back to 3Q, GDP growth was revised up three ticks to 5.2%, though real gross domestic income (GDI) only increased at a 1.5% pace. In principle GDP and GDI should equate, but the current discrepancy between year-ago real GDP growth (3.0%) and GDI growth (-0.2%) is the largest on record dating back to 1947. GDO, a simple average produced by the BEA, is up 1.4% over the past year, and may be a more faithful representation of what is going on in the economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Current-quarter GDP growth may be tracking a little below our estimate of 2.0%. On the favorable side of the ledger, October real consumer spending increased 0.2%, which is nothing special but is a little above what we had been expecting. This suggests that real annualized consumer spending growth this quarter could be running around the mid-2s. Less favorably, October news on inventory investment and foreign trade were more downbeat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Given the move lower in inflation, it’s not suiprising that Fed speakers have generally sounded content with the current setting of policy rates, consistent with our view that the Fed is done with hikes for this cycle. However they are still not on board with the market’s growing expectation for 1H24 rate cuts. Instead, most have signaled that they would like to keep</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">rates at their current restrictive level for some time. In Chair Powell’s remarks Friday, he didn’t signal any upcoming move in rates either way, echoing prior remarks by noting that the FOMC is moving “carefully” and that “the risks of under- and over-tightening are becoming more balanced.” However he did opt to highlight the six-month annualized run rate for the core PCE price index at 2.5%, noting that these lower inflation readings are “welcome.” He said that “progress [on inflation] must continue if we are to reach our 2 percent objective” but it seemed that Powell was feeling content with the progress seen so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">What they want to do and what they will do don’t always align. An earlier-than-expected start to rate cuts would likely occur only if the labor market deteriorates markedly. While job growth has been slowing, it has been a controlled descent. We expect that pattern to continue in next week’s November jobs report. We look for 150,000 new jobs; on the surface this would be the same as the October outturn, but after taking out the UAW distortion (which subtracted jobs in October and should add them in November) would be a continuation of the cooling pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Inflation’s edge comes off</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The softening in core PCE inflation continues to foster hope that the inflation surge of’21-’22 can be unwound without too much pain. The three- and six-month annualized increases in the core PCE price measure are 2.4% and 2.5%, respectively (Figure 1). This is still above the Fed’s 2% goal, but not by much.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The “super-core” category—core services excluding housing—increased 0.15% last month. On a year-ago basis this measure is still somewhat elevated at 3.9%, but recent outturns have been more favorable, as the three- and six-month annualized gains have been 2.7% and 3.1%, respectively. Keep in mind that sendees inflation tends to run above goods inflation, and so a normal super-core reading should be above 2%; in the ’95-’15 period of successful inflation control this measure averaged around 2.7%.</span></p>
