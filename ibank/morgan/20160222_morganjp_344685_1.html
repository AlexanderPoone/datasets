<p><span class="font1">High yield bonds have been very weak and volatile this year and spreads have widened at a shaiply faster pace in several additional sectors beyond commodities. There was some improvement in spreads last week but high yield spreads are still up very shaiply in 2016. Key is whether any of this widening in spreads foretells recession in the US and weakening credit as banks have not seen any material weakness or pickup in credit issues thus far in sectors beyond energy and metals/mining. Four key takeaways: 1) in six weeks of 2016, high yield spreads have widened by about 60% of the amount of widening seen in all of 2015; 2) Energy is by far the biggest area of concern in 2016 with the largest widening; 3) However, fears about metals/mining seem to be abating, with spreads increasing in 2016 much less than the median for all sectors, which is a shift from 2015 where metals/mining saw the largest increase in spreads; and 4) Weakness in high yield spreads has been worsened by large outflows from high yield bond funds overpast three months. Correlation between high yield spreads and GDP growth over past 16 years is moderate and mixed.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High yield markets calming down? </span><span class="font1">High yield bond index started very shaiply wider in first half of Jan (+92bp), little recovery in second half Jan (-17bp), wider again in first half of Feb (+69bp) but tighter last week (-3 Ibp). As a result, spreads are up 113bp YTD versus 187bp wider in full yr 2015.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Energy' and metals/mining remain the key areas of concern but rise in high yield spreads has broadened in ’16 to more sectors </span><span class="font1">with median increase of 101 bp ytd in the first seven weeks, not far from the median increase of 149bp in full year 2015. Energy spreads have widened the most, up 354bp ytd, but Mining has slowed, up 43bp, and 10 other sectors up 101-16 Ibp with the highest increases seen in Services, Transportation and Utilities. Energy and Mining high yield spreads are 700-800bp above the next highest sector, with spreads at 1720bp and 1640bp, respectively. The next highest spreads are in Chemicals (947bp) and Transportation (905bp). In 2015, metals/mining and energy sectors saw the highest increases, up 787bp and 590bp respectively, far above other sectors, and far above median increase of 149bp. Overall high yield spreads are at 87 Ibp with median of 773bp and most in 600-900bp range (see Table 1).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High yield bond funds have seen large outflows, </span><span class="font1">cumulatively $ 16.8bil since mid November - these have added pressure on high yield spreads. High yield funds had large inflows in the prior couple of years as investors sought yields.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back over the past 15 years, </span><span class="font1">widening high yield spreads had the most correlation with GDP growth during 2008-2009 crisis but less so in other periods such as 2011. The sharp widening in 2008-2009 coincided with the deep recession but less so in other periods.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the next credit cycle to be led by commercial loans, </span><span class="font1">mainly energy loans. Using the last C&amp;I loan driven cycle in 2001 when NCOs rose to 1-1.50% on average among our banks, this would hurt EPS by 8% annually on average with losses spread out over two years. We expect higher losses in leveraged Term B loans but these are in the shadow banking system.</span></p>
