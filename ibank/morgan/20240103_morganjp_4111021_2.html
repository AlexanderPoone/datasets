<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors’ concerns on Link REIT: We recently upgraded Link REIT (823.HK) to Overweight (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font2">). While investors seem to generally agree with an Overweight rating, they typically expressed the following concerns: (1) whether retail sales may have been impacted by more Hong Kong locals’ consumption shifting to Shenzhen (our view is limited impact); (2) whether positive rental reversion can continue into 2024 (our view is yes, although only low single digit); (3) whether CEO may continue to sell shares (we think it is still a medium-term risk, but unlikely in the near term); (4) whether “3.0” strategy is worth anticipating (we take a neutral view until execution; it’s an upside risk). Interestingly, most interest is from hedge funds, but their perspective is more to put Link REIT as a long in a pair trade (due to its more resilient operations) against a short position in Wharf REIC or SHKP.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decent short interest on Wharf REIC and SHKP: Most HFs we spoke to remain bearish on Hong Kong discretionary retail, and thus many remain interested in shorting Wharf REIC (1997.HK; UW). Some thought that the short-term rebound of Wharf REIC (likely driven by short covering) towards end-December now presents them a good opportunity to revisit a short. If we were to assume a 6% dividend yield for Wharf REIC, the implied share price would be HK$21, which represents another 16% potential downside. For some HFs who think Wharf RElC’s liquidity is not good enough for them, they are looking into shorting SHKP because (1) it is a proxy to the declining home price; (2) its dividend yield of 5-6% remains one of the lowest in the sector.</span></p></li></ul>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web traffic on property agencies slightly improved (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font2">): Web traffic grew 26% WAV. Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou and Wuhan saw a relatively higher interest level. On a Y Y basis, web traffic decline 5%, narrowing from -32% Y Y last week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60-city weekly sales update (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font2">): Sales grew 14% WAV, or if compared to the 4-year average it was 32% below (slightly improving from -42% the week before). However, the pick-up in sales is largely due to (1) sales registrations are usually backend loaded within a month, (2) developers were catching up to achieve the full-year contracted sales. For the full year of 2023, 60-city sales came down 8% Y/Y, or 36% below the 4-year average.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1">Weekly update on Hong Kong</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hong Kong residential market update (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span><span class="font2">): Web traffic on property agencies (Centaline &amp;&nbsp;Midland) saw a 13% WAV improvement (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 5</span><span class="font2">). and there is a small pick-up in weekly 35 major estates secondary transaction volume (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 14</span><span class="font2">). However, CCL dropped another 0.5% WAV, ordown 5.5% in 2023YTD, which suggests there might be more homeowners willing to lower asking prices.</span></p>
