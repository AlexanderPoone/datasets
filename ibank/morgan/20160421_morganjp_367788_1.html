<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Encouraging mobile trend and high operating leverage to drive earnings growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Unicom provided additional info such as cost details and KPIs in its results announcement today, after disclosing revenue and earnings in the profit warning statement on Monday. The results show encouraging trends in mobile business, although profitability was impacted by lower usage fees and a ramp-up in marketing efforts. We think CU's share price weakness, which relates to weak earnings and new entrant risk concerns, would provide a good entry point to play 2Q-3Q catalysts, such as a mobile service revenue turnaround in 2Q, sequential earnings improvement in 2Q and sentiment boost by the Chairman's appearance in Aug, etc.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobile ARPU up in 1Q16, on track to achieve revenue turnaround in 2Q16: </span><span class="font5">Mobile ARPU increased approximately 1.7% yoy from Rmb46.4 in IQ 15 to Rmb47.2 in IQ] 6, after declining for eight consecutive quarters. Billing customers reversed the downward trend in Jan and grew 2.6% during the quarter. However, mobile service revenue still declined by 1% due to around a 3% yoy drop in average billing customer count. Given the recent improving customer and ARPU trends, we expect to see low to mid single digit growth in mobile service revenue n 2Q16. Meanwhile, fixed-line revenue remained strong with 4% yoy growth.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EBITDA came down 21% yoy </span><span class="font5">due to: 1) ] Q]5 service EBITDA margin was a record high level of 42%: 2) a 37% yoy increase in network expenses largely due to additional lower usage fee of Rmb4.]bn: and 3) a 16% yoy increase in S&amp;M expenses compared wilh a low base in 1Q15, and ihis was slill 11 % less ihan the spending in 4Q15.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings tumbled by 85% </span><span class="font5">due io a significant decrease in EBITDA: There are a few positive changes among the below-EBITDA items. Depreciation dropped by 3% yoy attributable to lower savings, finance costs declined by Rmb0.3bn due to an absence of FX loss, and share of profit from the Tower Co. changed from a loss of Rmbl8 Imn in ] QI5 to a profit of Rmb358mn in ]Q] 6. Wilh accelerating lop-line growth and high operating leverage, we expect meaningful sequential improvement in earnings in the coming quarters.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About Tower Co.: </span><span class="font5">Tower usage fee was Rmb4. ]bn in ] Q]6 based on the previous leasing rale agreemeni, vs Rmb2.9bn spent in Nov-Dec and full year guidance of Rmb20bn. Negotiations are slill under way and we expect the final agreemeni lobe more favourable ihan ihecurrent one. Share of profit from the Tower Co. was Rmb358in ]Q16, which implies the new company made a profit of Rmbl .4bn during the quarter.</span></p></li></ul>
