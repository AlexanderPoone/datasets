<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Equity rally has been driven more by policy expectations than growth data</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the back of last week's surprisingly strong US data (e.g ISM Services and non-farm payrolls) our US macro team turned neutral (here) on both US Treasuries (from positive) and the US dollar (from negative). In general, better than expected fundamental newsflow G.e. economic/profit growth) should be good for stocks over the longer term, however in this instance it could unlock greater volatility in the short term given the heavy influence policy dynamics have had on the equity rally so far. For example, in Exhibit 1 we look at the weekly correlation since early October between equity performance and a number of different macro factors to see which of the Latter has been most important in driving the rally. As illustrated, our analysis suggests that the biggest support to equities in recent months has come from a weaker US dollar, hopes for easier Fed policy (FFZ4 which tracks market expectations for Dec-24 Fed Funds rate) and US bond yields. While Ellen Zentner believes that temporary factors drove much of the strong job growth in January she has revised her Fed projection and now expects two more rate hikes post recent FOMC commentary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Investors'safety cushion is starting to deflate</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">With the benefit of hindsight it is easy to justify this equity market rally since the start of October given that we have seen an improvement in the macro newsflow (Lower inflation and better growth than expected) against a backdrop of Low valuation and depressed investor sentiment/positioning. While the macro outlook could continue to improve from here, the 'safety cushion'that low valuation and depressed sentiment had previously provided has deflated considerably. On the latter, we can cite: i) Morgan Stanley's Global Risk Demand Index (GRDI) is close to a 10-year high; ii) the AAII 'net bulls' survey score turning positive after its Longest ever run in negative territory (44 consecutive weeks); iii) evidence of significant short covering having taken place. On valuation, the MSCI Europe index still Looks quite cheap on a N12M PE of 12.9, however the same valuation metric for Europe's median stock has risen to 15.9 which is toward the top end of its historical range (Exhibit 4). A less padded safety cushion is not a problem if the fundamental macro trends continue to improve, however there is now considerably Less margin for any disappointment going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Equities pricing better earnings revisions ahead - especially in Europe</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">At face value equities appear to have paid Limited attention to earnings-related data points in recent months, however we do think there is a Link once you adjust for a time lag Specifically, Exhibit 5 suggests that global equity prices have been (quite accurately) Leading consensus earnings revisions by c. 20 days for much of the last year and that revisions will get moderately 'Less bad' over the next few weeks. This seems plausible (given benign 4Q results and the recent improvement in global macro data), however the same chart for MSCI Europe is more concerning as it implies that a more optimistic earnings profile which would see revisions move well into positive territory (Exhibit 6). Although still early in the year, current EPS trends seem to be more consistent with the traditional 'top Left to bottom right' profile rather than the more unusual 'bottom left to top right' trend that we have seen over the last two years (Exhibit 2).</span></p>
