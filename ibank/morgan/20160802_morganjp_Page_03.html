<p><span class="font2">In light of the company’s recent operational developments, we maintain our OW view on the stock and adjust our DCF-based Dec-16 PT to HK$10. We remain positive on CP’s story given:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(1)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CP’s pure-play status - </span><span class="font2">we believe the company's shares had previously been penalized given CP’s exposure to the underperforming container leasing as well as declining ROE. But the restructured business should result in more stable core earnings growth (Adj. EBITDA CAGR of 7% from 2016-18) as well as FCF profile (FCF yield projected at 9-10% by FYI 8), the benefits of which should be evident in FYI 6 where assets that were previously disposed of (CIMC and Florens) are expected to record sharp earnings declines in 1H while CP’s core operations will be more resilient. Furthermore, we believe CP can raise the profitability of inbound assets (we have factored in limited expectations on this front) which could improve the company’s ROE profile.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(2)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential positive synergy effects post-COSCO/China Shipping merger </span><span class="font2">which could drive higher port utilization for key hub port assets while seeing greater volume support from newly formed OCEAN alliance in light of CPs close relationship with the parent group and sister companies. Materialization of such potential positive effects would pose as upside risks to our current estimates.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(3)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional capacity for overseas acquisitions given lowered gearing post-restructuring. </span><span class="font2">CP has identified several pipeline projects that mgmt believes could be executed in the near term (in FYI 6/17) if terms are agreeable. Additional announcements of overseas assets (which are generally more profitable than domestic ports) could help boost the company’s overall profitability, with the impact possibly becoming visible in the near-term given CP’s stated focus on brownfield assets. Furthermore, recent cooperation with CMHI could set a precedent for future coinvestments which we believe could be beneficial to both parties.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">We note that CP’s share price has fallen c7% YTD, outperforming the HSCEI index by c2% over the same period, but on a total return basis has outperformed the Index by c6% given the CP's special dividend of HK$80 cents per share distributed after the restructuring transaction was completed. Looking more closely, the company's shares actually rallied c30% between January and end-March this year but the share price corrected as much as c26% since then as throughput trends disappointed while the overall sector appeared to fall out of favor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">However, we believe at c0.6x FY16 P/B and c6.5x adjusted EV/EBITDA, the stock’s valuation is undemanding while we think street expectations have been calibrated to reflect the current lower volume growth environment (along with the rest of the sector). </span><span class="font2">Furthermore, we see limited downside catalysts in the near-term and expect the benefits of streamlined operations to become more evident in the coming quarters, particularly in light of the earnings volatility seen for disposed</span></p>
