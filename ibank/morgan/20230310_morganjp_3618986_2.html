<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>FX reserves fell $51.3bn</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">China’s FX reserves fell US$51.3bn to US$3,133.2bn in Feb-ruary (Figure 2), nearly offsetting the $56.8bn gain in January. We estimate the implied capital outflow at around $53.1bn for the first two months. After a temporary net increase at the end of 2022, total foreign holding of Chinese bonds declined a larger-than-expected US$15.7bn in January, the largest monthly decline since last May. We think the bond outflow pressure is hard to abate if the Fed is anticipated to hike more. Meanwhile, equity inflow peaked in January and may need more fundamental strength (macro recovery or corporate earnings) to attract further buying interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">PBOC officials mentioned that the central bank was comfortable with the two-way fluctuations around CNY in 2022, although the CNY volatility increased significantly compared to earlier years. Under the standard Mundellian Trilemma framework, the PBOC seems to have chosen monetary policy independence and flexible exchange rate over capital account liberalization, and we think it will continue to do so in 2023. The adjustment of macro-prudential tools, such as the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">FX risk reserve ratio</span><span class="font3">. FX deposit RRR, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">cross-border mac</span><span class="font3">-</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">ro-prudential adjustment parameter</span><span class="font3">, etc., has mostly served as a signal, as the actual impact on FX liquidity has been limited. The PBOC tends to roll out macro-prudential measures to manage market expectations and to avoid market arbitrage dominated carry trades that can chase CNY higher or lower too fast for its liking.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>CPI inflation eased on food prices</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The February CPI print came in below expectations, with deflation in PPI (-1.4%oya). Headline CPI rose 1.0%oya (vs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">2.1 %oya in January) on a 0.5% m/m sa fall. There was a significant decline in food prices, by 2.2% m/m sa. Core CPI remained soft, easing 0.1%m/m sa. As travel and entertainmentdemand eased after the LNY holiday, related prices came off in Feb </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ri</span><span class="font3"> ary (Figure 3). The soft Feb </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ri</span><span class="font3"> ary inflation prints highlight that pricing pressure remains modest despite the near-term post-COVID-19 rebound in economic activity.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">Looking ahead, a sustained growth recovery, broad-based improvement in labor market conditions and households’ income and employment expectations will be needed to provide a sustained boost to general pricing power for goods and services. We expect CPI inflation to stay around the 1% handle for most of this year (especially as the high base effect begins to kick in from March/April). We look for headline CPI inflation to average 1.4%y/y for 2023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Monetary policy should remain steady and growth-friendly, supported by easing inflation concerns. We assume a lObp reduction in policy rates in April. It appears the bias is that the PBOC may keep policy rates unchanged throughout 2023 and instead may lower market interest rates modestly (by 5-10bps) via further reform in the deposit and lending rate mechanism. In addition, we expect stable credit policy, with 2023 TSF growth at 9.5%oya.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>TSF flow and bank loans beat expectations</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The February credit report came in above expectations again, with solid increases in bank loans and aggregate financing. TSF increased 3.16 trillion yuan, with TSF growth at 9.9%oya (Figure 4). Credit impulse, the gap between TSF growth and nominal GDP growth, moved up further, to 5.6%pts. Bank loans came in above expectations again, increasing 1.81 trillion yuan in February, with the annual growth rate ticking up to 11.6%oya. The breakdown highlights ongoing strength in medium- and long-term loans to the corporate sector, reflecting the impact of growth-supportive credit policy, including credit support for developers to stabilize the housing market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Government bond issuance and corporate bond issuance both picked up in Febiuaiy. It seems the credit backdrop is broadly supportive of the key components of fixed investment (solid manufacturing and infrastructure FAI growth, as well as moderation in the sequential slowdown of real estate FAI) early this year. Household loans remained on the soft side, likely dragged on by early mortgage repayment, while housing market activity appears to be in the process of bottoming out.</span></p>
