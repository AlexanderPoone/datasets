<h6><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Sentiment should be boosted by rival TCLM 1Q margin improvements</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">Sky worth is the largest branded TV maker in the China domestic market. The 1QFY16 results just released by TCL Multimedia (20 April) should boost sentiment for Skyworth in our view. TCLM achieving strong gross margin improvement in the domestic market for the period from Oct 15 to Mar 16 despite a sharp drop in average selling price. This should be a big relief for Skyworth which has also seen a similar drop in selling prices over this period and we expect flat domestic GPM margin Y/Y over this period. We note that there has been some concern that falling ASPs may drag down the GPM for Sky worth when they report FYI 6 results later in June but the latest TCLM 1QFY16 results should alleviate this fear as it shows costs are falling much faster than ASPs.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TCLM 1QFY16 review. </span><span class="font4">TCLM reported a 1QFY16 Y/Y drop in ASP of about 10% for TVs (overall) and a 14% drop in ASP for its domestic TV sales. The sharp drop in domestic TV ASP (reported in HK$) is due to a 6% depreciation of the Rmb over this period plus a 8% drop domestic prices due to the plunging cost of production. TCLM also reported 1QFY16 Y/Y increase in GPM of 4.55% Y/Y for overall sales and 3.8% Y/Y improvement for domestic TV sales. The key to watch for Skyworth is the difference between TCL's domestic ASP decline and the GPM improvement for 1QFY16 which was as large as 18% (3.8% minus negative 14%). This indicates a plunge in costs of production. The equivalent spread number for 4QFY15 for TCLM is about 13% for domestic sales. Taken as a whole the 4QFY15 and 1QFY16 for TCLM which is equivalent to 2HFY16 for Sky worth (both Oct 15 to Mar 16), the spread between ASP change and GPM improvement is about 15% for TCLM.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Easier to believe in sustainable margin for Sky worth for 2HFY16. </span><span class="font4">Sky worth will report its FY16 (including its 2HFY16) results in June 2016. We expect a small 0.3% drop in 2HFY16 GPM (mostly domestic TVs) which is basically flat margins and is in line with management’s goals for maintaining margins over this period mentioned in last analyst briefing. We also estimate that 2HFY16 ASP for domestic TV sales (also reported in HK$) has fallen by 13% Y/ Y and our estimate is based on fairly accurate units and sales figures already reported by Skyworth for this period (Oct 15 to Marl 6). Therefore the difference between the domestic ASP change and GPM improvement for 2HFY16 for Sky worth is about 13% compared to 15% for a similar spread for TCLM calculated in the previous paragraph. Theoretically a lower spread is easier to achieve than a higher spread and the lower spread of Sky worth (13% vs 15%) gives us more confidence that a stable flat GPM for 2HFY16 Y/Y could be achieved. We won't know for sure until Sky worth reports but due to the similar nature and markets of TCLM and Sky worth's domestic businesses, we believe that concerns over downward pressure on Sky worth (due to falling ASPs) could be alleviated somewhat from the recent TCLM 1QFY16 achievements.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price, valuation and risk. </span><span class="font4">Our Dec-16 PT of HK$8.1 implies a forward P/BV of 1.4x and forward P/E of ~10x CY17E. Key risks to our PT are: timing of the commencement of government incentive /subsidy schemes for TVs, and a higher cost of components cutting into margins.</span></p></li></ul>
