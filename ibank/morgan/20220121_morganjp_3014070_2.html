<p><span class="font3">point to a significant squeeze on purchasing power at the start of the year. While next week should show the household saving rate rising shaiply in December, we expect it to reassert a downward trajectory in the first half of this year. We also anticipate businesses will look through the Omicron drag and continue to expand spending and hiring at a solid pace (Figure 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our confidence in the resiliency of the global expansion is tempered by inflation that continues to run faster than our forecasts, and recent developments that point to increased risk of unexpected commodity price pressures (Figure 3). Geopolitical tensions in the Ukraine </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">pose the risk of sanctions on Russia</span><span class="font3"> that are increasing crude oil prices and could disrupt supply. We assess the consequences of a negative oil supply shock in an accompanying note and </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">estimate that a material oil supply shock</span><span class="font3"> that doubles crude oil prices this quarter would materially weaken growth. In addition, traded agricultural prices are now rising sharply as a mix of harvest setbacks and increasing costs for fertilizer and transportation threaten to intensify already significant inflationary pressures that are particularly focused on emerging market economies.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>QT in focus as Fed meets, BoC hikes</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Even as growth momentum moderates, the march toward central bank policy normalization continues. At next week’s meeting we expect the Fed to signal that conditions for liftoff will soon be met, and lay the table for a 25bp hike in March. While we see a low chance that the Fed will speed up the taper at this meeting, the press conference and the FOMC minutes (released three weeks later) should further outline the parameters of the Fed’s runoff plans, which we expect to be phased in from July.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Bank of Canada also meets next week, when we expect the first of five 25bp hikes this year. Runoff of the BoC’s asset holdings is likely during 2H22. Tightening labor markets have accelerated exit plans for other DM central banks as</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">well. We expect </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">faster Euro area wage growth this year</span><span class="font3"> to warrant an end to ECB asset purchases in December with liftoff early next year; hawkish ECB minutes this week support our call. Robust labor market and inflation data this week add pressure on the BoE to hike again in Februaiy, which also would trigger the start of balance sheet runoff. A strong jobs report leaves us now expecting the RBA to bring an early end to its QE program at next month’s meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Balance sheet reduction by DM central banks will begin this year and accelerate into next, with asset runoff among most English-speaking central banks and the wind down of pandemic-related lending schemes by the ECB and BoJ </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">leading to a $1.6tn net reduction in holdings by end-2023</span><span class="font3">—about 15% of the post-pandemic buildup. Central banks’ expressed preferences are to use policy rates as their primary discretionary tool this cycle and put the balance sheet on “autopilot.” But the impact of QT on financial conditions, and therefore on the likely path for DM policy rates, is complex. Markets are pricing shallow and abbreviated hiking cycles against our forecast for elevated inflation and above-trend growth through the end of next year, and appear to view QT as a substitute for rate hikes. This implies an attenuated effect on financial conditions, and other research suggests a modest 20 to 50bp boost to longer-term bond yields from the Fed QT we project through end-2023. As such, there is a risk that DM central banks will need to tighten more than current market pricing to bring inflation sustainably back to target.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>China rebounds but questions remain</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The projected stabilization in China's growth this year is an important part of the global outlook. As reported this week, China’s real GDP grew 4%oya last quarter—a step down from the 4.9%oya outturn in 3Q21 but still a much-stronger-than-expected 7.5% annualized gain on a quarterly sequential basis. Factory output rebounded last quarter but still posted only a 3.1%ar gain, suggesting strong support from services as pandemic drags faded. Momentum in manufacturing output is quite strong into year-end, likely reflecting inventory restocking and stronger foreign sales. According to this week’s December activity data, final domestic demand growth remains soft on balance as retail sales and infrastructure spending continue to disappoint. Manufacturing investment remained the bright spot at year-end, supporting the broader signs of a rebound in global capex in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While China’s GDP beat expectations last quarter, domestic demand was sluggish through December and concerns about Omicron are increasing ahead of the upcoming LNY holiday and Olympics. Along with a slowing global backdrop this news prompts us to mark down growth this quarter by 0.7%-</span></p>
