<p><span class="font4">be the worst performing asset class in 2023. A year ago, the realization that the Great Moderation era had come to an end turned the focus to the need for the Fed to move “expeditiously.” The onset of Russia’s war on Ukraine, with the introduction of unprecedented sanctions and friend-shoring, further snapped the market out of complacency. But a year ago, there was still hope that inflationary pressures would be transitory and that the war could end quickly (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Top 10 Takeaways 2022 IMF/World Bank Spring meetings: Regime change in motion: end of gradualism and the great geopolitical realignment</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> Joyce Chang et al., 27 April 22). By last October, regime change was in full motion and policymakers warned that the “worst is yet to come” with aggressive tightening necessary to bring inflation down and the need to match “tough talk” with “tough action.” As the liability-driven investing (LDI) crisis in the UK unfolded during last fall’s annual meetings, it became apparent that the rapid rise in rates would inflict pain in some totally unexpected places, including in developed markets (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Top 10 Takeaways from our investor seminar at the time of the IMF/world Bank fall meetings 2022: Clear communication: Further pain still to come</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font4"> Joyce Chang et al., 18 Oct 22). While the events that played out in 2022 were a watershed year for regime change, the global economy and markets, marked by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the fastest pace of Fed tightening in decades alongside the highest inflation in 40 years, it is noteworthy that many macro and financial markets metrics remained relatively stable (Figure 1).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">At last week’s meetings, policymakers reconfirmed our views that inflation remains sticky, with central banks committed to “higher for longer” with an eventual US recession likely to materialize. </span><span class="font4">The time horizon is hard to identify, as there is a “slow burn” of risks that could play out over the course of the next 6 to 18 months rather than the next 3 to 6 months. The Fed may have arrived late to the party, but it has mostly caught up, and the peak Fed funds rate is likely within sight after 475bps of tightening over the course of 13 months. The risk of‘no normalization’ and ‘no landing’ was highlighted, with financial disruption deemed as a greater near-term risk than recession. The swift emergency action taken by to BoE last October has now become more of a norm to address financial stability risks, with policymakers using emergency authority with little hesitation given the speed with which SVB and Credit Suisse unraveled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">There was more talk of “de-risking” rather than “de-coupling” and “re-globalization” over “deglobalization.” </span><span class="font4">Russia’s war on Ukraine is now viewed as a frozen conflict that could extend well beyond 2024. Although the US-China strategic competition is a paradigm shift that is here to stay, there was less focus on the threat of new sanctions as a policy tool and acknowledgement of the need to improve communication channels</span></p>
