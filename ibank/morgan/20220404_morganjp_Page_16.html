<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We maintain 2022 GDP growth at 3.0%y/y, though we see downside risk</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">As political tensions within the government coalition linger, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to deteriorate with activity weakening amid rising inflation. Indeed, economic activity contracted sequentially in January, leaving output 3.6% below the cyclical peak reached in November 2017. Moreover, the drought and potential energy supply disruptions should weigh on crops and industrial production in 2Q22, adding downside risk to our forecast for a 2.5%q/q, saar GDP contraction. Worth noting, our GDP projections rely on the global commodity price surge boosting the trade surplus. Yet we flag that the probability of a technical recession in 2022 would increase above 50% if the terms of trade impulse turns negative. For now, we maintain as a base case a 3.0%y/y GDP growth projection for 2022 (0.6%Q4/Q4), though we see downside risk.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Activity started on the weak side</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Economic activity contracted 0.5%m/m, sa in January, in line with our expectation, expanding 5.4%oya. Thus, activity printed 4.6% above the February 2020 pre-pandemic level in January, yet fell 3.6% short of the cyclical peak in November 2017 (Figure 1). Compared to pre-pandemic output, the supply side breakdown shows that commerce, construction, and manufacturing have expanded by 8.6%, 8.3%, and 1.6%, respectively. But activity in some services sectors was still well below pre-COVID-19 norms, with output of Restaurants &amp;&nbsp;Hotels and Transportation was still down 24.5% and 7.7%, sa, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That said, the post-COVID-19 recovery masks the more profound and long-lasting depression since the sudden stop of capital inflows in April 2018. With the exception of Agriculture, Mining, Real Estate, Public Administration, Education, and Health, sectoral activity is still well below the levels at the cyclical peak before the sudden stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our GDP growth projection for 1Q22 remains at 1.0%q/q saar; the drought and energy risks are likely to weigh on crops and industrial production in 2Q22. The spike in energy prices, particularly for LNG, may prompt quantitative restrictions that curtail firms’ production rather than affect households, given the political sensitivities in play. Moreover, the inflation pickup in recent weeks is also likely to reduce real disposable income and drag on private sector consumption. These two factors compound, adding downside to the 2.5%q/q, saar contraction we already forecast for 2Q22. Moreover, without reforms, we believe the economy will continue to struggle not only to achieve self-sustaining growth but also to recover the 2017 activity peak, amid the increased role of the inefficient public sector in the economy (Figure 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">That said, commodity prices are still supportive from a trade balance standpoint. Our expectation that commodity prices will remain elevated, plays a key role in our forecast of continued economic growth in 2H22. The JPM commodities research team’s latest price forecasts for oil, gas, and the agrocomplex from the (see “Global Commodities: The Week in Commodities” 28-Mar-22), imply a trade surplus boost, that would help to alleviate pressure on the external accounts and the parallel exchange rate and thus to avoid a further pickup in underlying inflation from what we have incorporated in our baseline outlook.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regarding exports, we now expect prim ary exports (soy, com, and wheat) to reach US$42bn this year at, US$7.5bn above our forecast before the Russia-Ukraine war. In the same way, we now expect 2022 oil exports to be US$0.5bn higher than in our previous baseline scenario, reaching US$2.8bn. We expect total exports to print at US$84bn this year.</span></p>
