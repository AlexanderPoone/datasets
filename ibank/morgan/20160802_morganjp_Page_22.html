<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">YTD volumes weak but saw sequential improvement in 2Q16; expecting some stabilization but sharp rebound unlikely in 2H16</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">1Q16 results from continuing operations came in weaker than expected as throughput growth was muted while certain key items drove recurring profits down further.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Headline NP was US$109MM (+31% Y/Y), but this included a one-off disposal gain of US$59MM related to the disposal of the company's leasing business which was used to exchange for CSPD's assets. Stripping this out, NP would actually have been down 26% Y/Y while total equity throughput would have risen 3.1% Y/Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Several items further affected the 1Q16 result including 1) a one-off US$5MM legal expense related to the company's port in Yangzhou which was booked into admin expenses (excluding this, we estimated the NP drop would have been cl7% Y/Y instead), 2) the expiration of Shanghai Mingdong Port's tax holiday; and 3) higher tax rate in Greece implemented in mid-2015. Rmb depreciation, which fell c4.6% in 1Q16 also affected reported financial numbers as CP reports in USS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If we take out volumes from Turkey and Korea (which were only included beginning January 1<sup>st</sup> 2016), we see that 1 QI6 total organic throughput was flat Y/Y as the YRD and PRD regions both recorded negative volume growth. However, we saw total organic volume growth rebound mildly in 2Q16 to +1.2% Y/Y (in line with improving volumes in China) suggesting that we could see slightly stronger growth trends in 2H16 particularly as the base from last year eases (1 QI 5 volumes were strong in China but growth slowed after Februaiy and the trend continued to weaken until the end of the year) while the weaker Rmb could trigger some increase in inventory replacement demand, particularly from Europe which has seen some rebound in volumes after observing negative growth and underperforming last year. That said, we do not anticipate a sharp rebound in growth rate as trade flows could continue to see pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Summary of key assumptions</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our key operating assumptions are summarized below. Overall, we forecast mild organic and total throughput growth while anticipating substantial yield dilution in 2016 on the back of the incorporation of less profitable assets from China Shipping as well as Rmb depreciation. For consolidated assets, we anticipate mild margin expansion over time on operating leverage improvements as volumes rise. We also highlight our current assumptions with respect to potential synergies from the COSCO/China Shipping merger and future acquisitions as well as key upside and downside drivers for each.</span></p>
