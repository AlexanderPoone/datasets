<p><span class="font7">Following the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last week, we wanted to pass along key takeaways from the meeting for the life science tools, diagnostics, CRO/CDMO and med tech group, as well as for the 44 companies in our coverage universe that presented.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tools saw generally strong 4Q pre-announcements aided by strong COVID tailwinds alongside healthy 2022 commentary, although this did not help share price performance during the week. </span><span class="font7">Tools companies sounded upbeat and flagged healthy end markets going into 2022, specifically pointing to continued biopharma tailwinds and a positive funding environment. On preannouncements, companies beat 4Q aided by strong COVID contributions and healthy base business recovery (DHR +10%, etc.). There were no surprising updates to 2022 guidance for the group (it is still too early to lift FY22 expectations to account for recent COVID tailwinds), while PKI and AVTR updated LT guidance to reflect recent M&amp;A. The tools group continues to underperform (majority down -10% YTD with BRKR standing out at down -16% YTD), as we see a continued rotation away due to a myriad of reasons (difficult comps, valuation, supply chain concerns, peak margins, COVID-roll off, etc.) despite generally positive news during the week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply chain, labor, inflation and general macro talking points were brought up by all names, but largely downplayed, as the majority of companies are not baking headwinds into 2022 (most cited pricing power as a reason)... </span><span class="font7">Both CROs and labs noted that wage inflation will be a headwind in 2022 (DGX noted that its wage increase in 2022 will be +3-4% vs. the typical +2-3% per year) although almost all service companies noted plans to pass the higher costs off to customers via pricing. The core tools group flagged supply chain pressures, but these have generally been managed, similar to 3Q, although PKI noted that supply chain pressured 4Q more than expected (after the company included some conservatism in the guide) and estimated supply chain constraints and APAC shutdowns were a -200-300 bps headwind to organic growth during 4Q. As noted, on inflationary pressures, the tools group pointed to higher-than-nonnal pricing increases in 2022 to offset the increased costs.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sequencing space had the most in terms of R&amp;D updates, starting with long read... </span><span class="font7">The biggest news on the sequencing front was ILMN’s announcement of a brand new chemistry (Chemistry X, details below) </span><span class="font7" style="font-style:italic;">and</span><span class="font7"> a long-read technology called Infinity (acquired from Longas) that can deliver 10 kb read lengths on the same existing short-read instalment, with the company touting the potential advantages of 90% less DNA input requirements and lOx higher throughput vs. legacy long-read technologies. Few technological details and performance data were provided on Infinity, as ILMN is withholding details until early access in 2H22, although the news indiscriminately pressured other sequencing stocks (PACB, ONT, OMIC), however, none of the competitors we spoke with (not suiprisingly) view Infinity as a real threat - rather, it is viewed as ILMN’s acknowledgement of the importance of long-read sequencing. Both PACB and ONT believe Infinity is not true single-molecule long-read sequencing, but rather short-read sequencing stitched together through</span></p></li></ul>
