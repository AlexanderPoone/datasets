<p><span class="font5">While we remain concerned about choppy FX spot price action one-touch calendar may still be of interest. Exhibit 3 takes a stab at various tenor combinations of USD/CAD call one-touch calendar spreads. The constructs tend to do best when spot is either range-bound or slowly moving toward the strike and specifically two types of backdrops tend to work in favor: 1) inverted vol curves (CAD curve is only very modestly inverted at the front), and 2) high skew pricing (very much the case for USD/CAD right now). Short IM vs long 2M calendar spread has -2 5 pts of static cany when barriers are set to ~ 1.3 850 (-50% TV on 2M tenor), ~15pts at 1.3950 (~30% TV) and slightly cany positive at 1.4 050 (the level not reached since the COVID onset in 2 020).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The resilience displayed by the EMFX asset class this year, in a context characterized by elevated market volatility and sharply rising DM rates/yields, has been remarkable. Exhibit 4, LHS shows a proxy total return performance of a EMFX portfolio vs. USD since 2020, flat since the start of the year and this despite the USD rally. While optically the performance might be polluted by currencies such as RUB, that would have been difficult to trade due to diy liquidity, it nonetheless allows stressing the importance of the cany component that allowed compensating for the spot losses. Needless to say, the relative performance against EUR or JPY would be even more impressive, thanks to positive contributions from both spot and Cany angles.</span></p>
