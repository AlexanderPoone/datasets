<p><span class="font3">Using the revenue data in the results announcement, we estimate the occupancy cost ratio rose from 19% in 2015 to 23% 1H16 at Harbor City and 22% in 2015 to 27% in 1H16 for Times Square. The company emphasized that the retail revenue data included other income such as management fee, air-conditioning fee and car park income. Therefore, for a like-for-like comparison with other peers, the occupancy cost based on pure rentals for HC and TS was 19.8% (16% in 2015) and 24.5% (20% in 2015) respectively in 1H16. Even so, affordability has started to look stretched, and we believe this will create a more difficult outlook for rental reversion going forward unless the improvement in retail sales continues. Wharf still recorded a single-digit positive rental reversion in 1H16.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Ocean Terminal extension bringing new attractions to boost traffic</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The new extension building at Ocean Terminal is targeted for opening by 3Q17. It is expected to provide additional retail GFA of 40-45K sf (~2% of total retail area). The new space is planned to house some premium F&amp;B outlets. Even though the additional space and rental income are limited, we believe this can help draw foot traffic towards the end of Ocean Terminal benefitting the tenants along the entire avenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Wharf will also convert some office space at Gateway to retail. China Tang and an Adidas flagship store were opened, whereas additional retail space amounting to 7,700 sf will be created by 2017. Conversion of the former cinema is also underway.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Overall China IP still sees good momentum as rental revenue was up 7% YoY to HK$1.2bn.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Chengdu IFS mall continues to deliver growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mall at Chengdu IFS has continued to ramp up since opening in early 2014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While retail revenue increased by 9% YoY to Rmb312mn, tenants’ sales outpaced the growth by increasing 13% YoY to Rmbl.8bn and are on track with the full-year target of double-digit growth. Turnover rent accounted for 16% of total rental income. Occupancy cost is still at a healthy level of 15%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">However, on the office side, leasing activity remained muted, with only 36% of total GFA leased (compared to 30% committed as of August 2015).</span></p>
