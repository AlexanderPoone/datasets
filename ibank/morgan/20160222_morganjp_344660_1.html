<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patterson Companies (PDCO/N, Thurs am). </span><span class="font1">We believe PDCO is likely to deliver F3Q16 EPS in line with expectations, although we point to a somewhat spotty track record for delivering results relative to expectations over the past few years. We project total revenues to grow 47.0% y/y, driven largely by the impact of the Animal Health International acquisition. We project adjusted EPS of $0.66 (up 35.2% y/y driven by the Animal Health International acquisition), which is $0.01 below Bloomberg consensus. We expect the company to narrow the FY16 adjusted EPS guidance range of $2.40-$2.50, as the current range would imply a relatively wide range for F4Q16, although we wouldn’t expect the midpoint of the range to move dramatically. We expect the focus on the call to be on the underlying market growth, coupled with trends in dental equipment and the performance of the Animal Health International business.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolent Health (EVH/OW, Thurs pm). </span><span class="font1">We forecast revenues of $43.6M for Q4, up 63% y/y, in line with consensus of $43.7M and compared to guidance of $43-$44M. We model an EBITDA loss of ($ 10. IM) for the quarter, compared to consensus of ($9.7M) and guidance of ($9.5-$ 10.5M). The company will also provide initial guidance for 2016, its first ftill year as a public company. We are projecting a 31% increase in revenues to $210M (compared to consensus of $212M), with continued losses at the adjusted EBITDA line totaling ($30.0M), compared to the consensus of ($29.3M). We expect the call to focus on financial impact of the Passport Health partnership and other recent wins and whether the pipeline of new business is on track to reach management’s goal of 4-6 new large contracts per year. Also look for results of the open enrollment season for client health plans and expected growth in lives on EV H’s platform from existing clients.</span></p></li></ul>
