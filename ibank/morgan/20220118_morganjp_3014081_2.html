<p><span class="font2">assess Omicron’s effect on non-inpatient trend, but we think the impact will be smaller compared to previous case surges given higher vaccination rates and macro data indicating lower severity associated with this variant. BHG noted that providers are actively trying to get patients into clinics and that fewer patients are deferring care relative to previous waves. As it relates to the Biden administration announcement that commercial health plans would be required to cover up to eight at-home COVID tests per individual per month, while this could represent a potential headwind in a vacuum, the net impact wasn’t immediately clear, as several pointed to potential offsets, such as a reduction in lab tests and lower utilization.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While it is still early, companies sounded positive on direct contracting. </span><span class="font2">Witliin our coverage universe, several of the newly-public managed care companies as well as tech-enabled providers focused on primary care. The tone was optimistic on DEC, with companies generally pointing to positive early trends over the first 9 months of the program with expectations for y/y improvement in 2022. We note that AGL indicated that it expects DCE profitability to decline in 4Q21, due to a retroactive benchmark adjustment negatively impacting revenue, which we believe could also be a headwind for other players including ALHC, CLOV, OSH and PRVA, although we expect investors will largely look through it.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COVID vacci nes/testing to remain a near-term tail wind for those involved in administration and distribution. </span><span class="font2">Both CVS and WBA pointed to stronger than expected impact from COVID vaccines and testing, with CVS raising the FY21 and implied 4Q21 guidance and WBA doing the same in conjunction with their F1Q22 earnings release the week prior. That said, CVS kept the initial FY22 guidance unchanged at this point as it works through the closing process and the analytic work to determine if there was a pull forward in volume, or if there are other potential offsets in other areas of the business. MCK did not provide an update beyond what it had provided at their Investor Day on 12/8, although we will be waiting for additional color when the company reports F3Q22 results on Febiuary 2. Finally, we note that other distribution companies across our coverage universe that could benefit from elevated testing include MCK, CAH and HSIC.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAH pointed to incremental headwinds, although others noted that impact from supply chain, inflation and labor already factored in. </span><span class="font2">The impact from these factors is largely dependent on company-specific factors, including markets served, types of products, etc. CAH lowered their FY22 outlook as a result of incremental pressures on the Medical segment (beyond what had previously been included in their FY22 outlook. Several other distributors also noted that they are seeing headwinds, although this impact, as well as planned mitigation efforts, are already factored into existing guidance (e.g., ABC, MCK, HSIC and PDCO). We also note that the updated outlook provided by Walgreens with its F1Q22 earnings earlier this month also factored in an incremental headwind from increased labor costs. And LFST noted at the conference that clinician retention levels remained stable in the 80% range, which, as previously discussed, is down from the prior 87% range. We note that there continues to be some debate as to whether these factors are ultimately transitory in nature or structural, and we will continue to look for color around potential mitigation efforts with C4Q results in the coming weeks.</span></p></li></ul>
