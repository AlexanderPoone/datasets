<p><span class="font3">We update our Weichai model to reflect new industry forecasts for the HDT market. We raise Weichai revenue forecast by +4%/+5% FYI6/17E, and adjust net profit by +8%/+7% for FY16/17E. Management expects its HDT engine market share at c25% in FY16 rising from 21% inFY15. Weichai's expansion benefited from increasing procurement from FAW, rising to cl6% in 2016 from last year's 8%. On the other hand, Beiqi Foton has not yet raised procurement from Weichai in a meaningful way. From April 2015, Beiqi Foton changed its strategy, reducing levels of procurement from Weichai and switching to in-house production through its JV with Cummins. This change in strategy however resulted in decline in market share in the domestic HDT market by cumulative c4ppts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We see sales of hydraulic components in China as a new growth driver. Mgmt aims to gain a third of market share in China's high-end hydraulics component sector, which is estimated at cRmbl5B per year. Its domestic factory in Weifang city, which started operations in May 2015, is expected to produce c8,000 units in 2016, doubling from oya. Mgmt expects the hydraulics segment to break even at the net level this year, to become a growth driver from 2017 onwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Maintain OW on Weichai Power, rolling over our PT timeframe and raising our DCF-based PT to HK$15.0 by Dec-2017 (vs prior HK$13.7 by Dec-2016). We expect 3Q16 earnings of cRmb500MM, up c580% Y/Y on a low base. Weichai's 3Q15 saw margin compression on operating deleverage as sales volume was low during the period. Weichai 3Q16 engine production rose to c50k units vs less than c40k (profit break-even point) units during last year's same period.</span></p>
