<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Strong sales and operating earnings growth in 1Q as expected</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">China State Construction (CSC) is one of the largest contractors for affordable housing (AH) in China and one of the largest builders in HK/Macau. The company reported 1Q16 results with sales up 18.1% Y/Y to HK$8.7bn and EBIT (including profit from jointly controlled entities) growing at 20% Y/Y to HK$1.286bn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Very close to expectations: While we do not have detailed IQ estimates (only certain figures released for IQ), growth in IQ sales of 18.1% is in line with our 1H16 sales growth estimate of 17.3% and 1Q16 EBIT (including profit from jointly controlled entities) growth of 20.3% is in line with our expectations of 21% for 1H16 growth in EBIT.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Remain positive on the stock: These latest figures support our view that the earnings growth rate of over 20% CAGR from 2015 to 2016 (29% to be precise) would continue for the next few years (we cst. 19% 15-18 CAGR in NP) based on contracts already in hand (HK$140bn backlog or3.8x 15 sales). This stable earnings growth rate from 2005 to 2 018 is attractive given the company’s - 9x CY16PE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">IQ results announcement: </span><a href="http://www.hkcxncws.hk/listedco/listconcws/schk/2016/0422/LTN20160422203.pdf"><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">http://www.hkcxncws.hk/listedco/listconcws/schk/2016/0422/LTN20160422203.pdf</span></a></p>
<p><span class="font5">Price target, Valuations, Risks: Our DCF-based PT (Dec-16) of HK$18.0 implies FY17E P/E of 10.4x and FY16E P/B of 2.3x. Key risks are falling construction activity in China and lower-than-expected returns on long-term projects in China. Another risk would be a shortage of workers or a hike in raw materials that could crimp margins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Please sec our latest update: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">China State Construction: Lifting PT to HK$18 - strong orders in IQ</span><span class="font5"> - dated 21 April for details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">China State Construction (CSC) is one of the hugest contractors in Hong Kong and the largest contractor for affordable housing in China. CSC combines the benefits of international construction experience with access to the resources of the parent group, China State Construction and Engineering Corp, the largest contractor for buildings in China. New government policy to promote the construction of affordable housing is a key growth driver for CSC. Build-Transfer (BT) projects are used for the construction of affordable housing and infrastructure in China. This relatively new type of contract has higher margins than traditional cash contracts because it requires contractors to fund projects during the construction period and are repayable to the contractor for the two- to three-year period after completion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Dec-16 price target is based on a DCF valuation that assumes a market risk premium of 6.0% and a risk-free rate of 4.2% (yield on 10-year government notes in China). We assume a beta of 1.2. Accordingly, WACC is assumed at 10.2%. We have estimated free cash flow for CSC until FY20 and assume a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. The terminal growth is based on the annual growth rate expected in FY20 (the final year of the estimate period), subject to a minimum of 3% and a maximum of 6%, depending on the nature of the industry and the level of maturity in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The key downside risks to our PT include falling construction activity in China and lower-than-expected returns on long-term projects in China. Other risks include a shortage of workers and a hike in raw materials, which could crimp margins.</span></p>
