<p><span class="font4">Banxico’s minutes for last week’s meeting (+50bp, unanimous) should strike a hawkish tone as building inflation concerns are exacerbated by the start of policy normalization by the Fed. Broadly speaking, we expect the minutes to show that Banxico should at least maintain its 50bp hiking pace in May, and given the evolution of short-term risks it could deliver an additional 50bp in June—alongside the Fed—before shifting back to 25bp increases. We continue to expect year-end policy rate at 8.25%, with some upside risk. Speaking to building inflation pressures, we expect March inflation to be strong, with core maintaining its rapid 0.6% monthly rate, and the 3m/3m rate at 8%ar, the highest in at least two decades. Growing signs of inflation becoming inertial underpin our call for year-end inflation to hit 7.2%oya, much higher than Banxico forecasts. Finally, this week we revised our growth forecast for the year higher to 1.9%y/y from 1.5% on the back of what we expect to be a much stronger IQ (6%ar from 3.5%), even if we trimmed 2Q-4Q on growing global risks. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(G.

<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Argentina: Activity weakens while political tensions linger</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As political tensions within the government coalition linger, the macroeconomic backdrop continues to deteriorate with activity weakening amid rising inflation. Indeed, economic activity contracted sequentially in January, leaving output 3.6% below the cyclical peak reached in November 2017. Our GDP growth projection for 1Q22 remains at 1.0%q/q saar; the drought and energy risks are likely to weigh on crops and industrial production in 2Q22. The spike in energy prices, particularly for LNG, may prompt quantitative restrictions that curtail firms’ production rather than affect households, given the political sensitivities in play. Moreover, the inflation pickup in recent weeks is also likely to reduce real disposable income and drag on private sector consumption. These two factors compounded add downside to the 2.5%q/q, saar contraction we already forecast for 2Q22. Moreover, without reforms, we believe the economy will continue to struggle not only to achieve self-sustaining growth but also to recover the 2017 activity peak, amid the increased role of the inefficient public sector in the economy. We note that our GDP projections rely on the global commodity price surge boosting the trade surplus. Yet we flag that the probability of a technical recession in 2022 would increase above 50% if the terms of trade impulse turns negative. For now, we maintain as a base case a 3.0%y/y GDP growth projection for 2022 (0.6%Q4/Q4), though we see downside risk. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(D. Pereira/L.

<p><span class="font4">The CBC Board decided to hike the policy rate by 150bp, to 7%, in a unanimous decision last week, below our forecast (+175bp) and BBG consensus (+200bp). While not explicit, the statement suggests a key reason behind this “dovish” hike is the global shock associated with the conflict in Ukraine. The statement does recognize that inflation expectations have moved higher and, most relevant, that expectations for the policy horizon remain well above the 3% target. Yet against this backdrop, the Board not only hiked less than what was expected and priced in but also provided somewhat dovish forward guidance, noting that future increases in the policy rate are likely to be smaller than recent ones. The timing of this message embedded in the policy report may prove risky. If inflation runs higher and/or is more persistent than in the</span></p>
