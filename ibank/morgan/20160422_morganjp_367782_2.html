<p><span class="font4">We believe CEA has the best geographical hub location which will benefit from Shanghai's ETZ and Disneyland with sufficient airport capacity enabling the airline to expand its operations. Its fleet simplification and renewal will also help improve unit cost. Other positive drivers: margin upside from more premium traffic, rising travel penetration in China, yield recovery, traffic feed from Skytcam Alliance partners, enhanced co-operation with Delta and Qantas, liberalization of China's air links, low oil prices, industry consolidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Jun-17 price target of HK$6.0 is based on 1.2x P/B, in line with China Eastern's historical average valuation since listing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Downside risks inlucde: China's economy weakens, rising competition from high-speed rail on domestic short-haul flights &lt;2 hours, rising fuel prices, rising LCC competition, further weakening of the CN Y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Further catalysts: Better-than-expected traffic and yield growth, falling jet fuel prices, Rmb rebound, earlier-than-expected success of its low-cost-carrier JV and a potential strategic investor.</span></p>
