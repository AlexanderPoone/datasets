<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">With elections com ing on 14/28 May (lst/2nd round), we look at two scenarios </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">(link)</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;"> of post-election policy as laid out by our Economics/FTCC strategy teams where their “strong commitment to policy orthodoxy” generates 74% upside in MSCI Tiirkiye in USD terms but their “modest return to orthodox polices” generates29% downside. </span><span class="font7">Inline with the FX and rate changes envisaged in the two scenarios, from a top-down equities view, we expect a big re-rating in the Strong Commitment case from 4.6xPE to 9.2x PE but still a 35% discount to EM and no re-rating in the Modest Return case. The key drivers of equity returns are FX and PE re-rating. We rem ain Neutral on Turkiye in our CEEMEA and EM equity allocation. For investors looking at the upside, we would position in key domestic sectors - banks and staples as well as Koc Holding, a diversified hold co.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The push-pull on equities will be the potential downside from a weaker TRY, which is inevitable according to our HCC team, versus the potential upside of re-rating EM’s cheapest market, which is only likely with a Strong Commitment to orthodoxy. </span><span class="font7">Turkiye trades on 4.6x 12m fwd consensus PE on the non-financials and c2x for the financials. Should Tiirkiye stick to orthodox macro policies, we think it should trade a) closer to its median PE over the last 15 years and b) narrow the discount to EM. When we compare Turkish stocks to EM sector averages, the median discount in the 201 O’s was 28%, then 46% in the last 15 years and is 65% now. Stocks would double if the discount reverted to the average of the 2010s. Meanwhile, the recent jump in trading volumes makes Tiirkiye liquid enough ev en for the biggest GEM funds - its 5% of CEEMEA m arket cap and 40% of trading volume with the MSCI stocks trading $1,4bn ADTV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Positioning: Foreign ownership of the stock market has fallen sharply in the last the four years from &gt;60% to only 29%. </span><span class="font7">Looking at EM funds positioning, we see that Tiirkiye is still in the m iddle of the EM pack in terms of OW and UWs - at least comparing it to other small (i.e. sub-2%) EM markets. Pushing foreign equity ownership back to 50% would mean c. $ 15-20bn FX inflows.</span></p>
