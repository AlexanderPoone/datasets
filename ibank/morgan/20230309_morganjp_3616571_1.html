<p><span class="font6">The earnings season, while not as bad as feared, did confinn emerging cracks within coiporate fundamentals. EPS revisions continued to move to the downside with 2023 EPS revised down by -$8 YTD to -$222. Rising cost of capital remains a key concern for corporates (see </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Cost of Higher for Longer</span><span class="font6">). In fact, a growing number of Small caps who are particularly sensitive to higher rates (i.e. 40% of S&amp;P 600 debt is floating) have flagged rising interest expense as a key margin headwind. Even though Large cap balance sheets remain healthy to date, Small caps and the private sector could see material deterioration from higher rates with the risk of those issues ultimately penneating into Large caps in the fonn of lost demand, lower margins and/or asset write-downs/credit losses. We continue to expect $205 EPS for 2023 (-$210 on an fx/usd normalized basis). Earnings expectations still remain elevated going into 2H23 where consensus sees net income inargins expanding versus 1H23. In our view, 2H23 earnings expectations remain a high bar for corporates to clear given sticky labor costs, rising cost of capital pressures (see Figure 2) and risk of demand slowing in the latter part of this year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Beats/Misses. </span><span class="font6">With 98% of S&amp;P 500 companies having reported, 64% beat 4Q earnings (vs. 70% avg. last 4Qs, see Figure 1) and 66% beat revenue estimates (vs. 69%). Beats have been slightly better ex-Financials with 66% of companies beating 4Q earnings (vs. 70% avg last 4Qs) and 68% beating revenue estimates (vs. 72%). Sectors with highest percent of earnings beats include Technology (82%), Healthcare (76%) and Industrials (70%). However, only two sectors exceeded their past 4Qs average in tenns of earnings beats: Healthcare (76% vs. 72% avg prev 4Qs) and Discretionary (67% vs. 63%). While earnings beats did improve on the margin compared to the previous quarter (64% current vs. 62% 3Q22), S&amp;P 500 beats remain well off their 2Q21 peak of 88%.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Suiprise. </span><span class="font6">Net income has suiprised to the downside for the second quarter in a row at -2.2% though slightly better ex-Financials at -1.2%. Both revenue and earnings suiprise were largely supported by more defensive sectors such as Healthcare (1.8% and 3.7%, respectively) and Staples (2.4%, 3.2%).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revenue Surprise. </span><span class="font6">Revenue has suiprised to the upside by 1.5% though far less than over the past year (i.e. 2.5% on avg through past 4Qs). Almost 70% of the revenue surprise was driven by Bond Proxies alone. Among sectors, the major contributors to revenue suiprise were Utilities (51%), Healthcare (23%), Staples (17%) and Discretionary (17%, see Figure 10). Note, these values will exceed 100% if the percentages are summed given the netting versus sectors with downside suiprise.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earnings Surprise. </span><span class="font6">Earnings results disappointed expectations for another quarter coming in at -2.2% (vs. -0.3% in 3Q22). The downside surprise was largely driven by Cyclicals (-87% contribution, -4.2% suiprise, see Figure 11). Among sectors, Financials (55%, -7.2%), Communication (37%, -8.8%) and Energy (27%, -5.3%) were the largest contributors to the downside suiprise. Healthcare was one of the few bright spots with an earnings surprise of 3.7%. Turning to EPS surprise, this was the first quarter since the pandemic (i.e. 1Q20) and GFC before it where EPS suiprise was negative (-1.0% for 4Q22, see Figure 8). This EPS print falls significantly short of the median suiprise over the past -20 years of -4%.</span></p></li></ul>
