<p><span class="font4">firms don’t appear to be opting for many layoffs. And low levels of jobless claims filings reported through much of December echo this message from the November JOLTS report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fed minutes don’t signal timing of a cut</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe the apparent resilience of the labor market should dial down expectations of a Fed rate cut in 1Q, and we still look for easing to begin at the June meeting. The minutes to the December 12-13 FOMC meeting didn’t surprise in a big way and didn’t suggest that a rate cut is imminent. The minutes rather confirmed that the Committee now sees rates “at or near” the peak for the cycle, and this was reflected in the revised forward guidance. However, that guidance still left intact “the possibility of further increases” if inflation were to surprise on the upside. “Almost all participants” noted that the improved inflation outlook meant rate cuts in ’24, though they are still very far from getting into the game of guessing when those cuts may start. It was also noted the outlook for these cuts was “associated with an unusually elevated degree of uncertainty” (the minutes rarely note an unusually low degree of uncertainty).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Committee generally views the risks to inflation as still skewed to the upside, though by not as much as in prior meetings. Some sources of lingering upside risk include the recent easing in financial conditions and global factors could end or reverse the easing in goods prices. On growth there was the contending concern that the Committee could find that policy is ultimately overly restrictive, which could be compounded by slower foreign growth and tighter bank credit, particularly for small businesses. Both the Committee and the staff saw a tough year ahead for CRE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The minutes record that “several” participants anticipate slowing the pace of balance sheet runoff before stopping that runoff. It was also noted that these participants thought the technical discussion should begin so that the public has appropriate advance notice of the plan. We suspect this means that we could see a fuller discussion of potential balance sheet plans in the minutes to the next meeting, which takes place later this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">4Q GDP still looking modest</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We have long been anticipating a clear slowing in GDP growth in the fourth quarter following the very strong third quarter of last year and we continue to calibrate our estimate for 4Q as we get more related information over time. There were some upside surprises this past week, but we continue to see some downside risk to our 2.0% real GDP growth forecast for 4Q23. We should also note that much of the slowing in growth we expect between the third and fourth quarters is</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">related to inventories. Inventories added 1.3%-pts to GDP growth in 3Q but we think they could subtract about a percentage point (or more) from GDP growth in 4Q. That said, there are limited related hard data in hand at this point. For domestic final sales growth, we expect growth to moderate between these quarters, but we do not look for a particularly drastic step down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">On the whole, the November construction report came out above expectations, with a somewhat disappointing change reported for November (0.4%) but upward revisions to earlier figures (mainly in October). Private residential spending led the way in November, with a 1.1% monthly increase that month, and generally has been climbing at a solid pace in recent months (Figure 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Auto sales also surprised favorably, rising 3.2% to 15.8mn saar in December. This marked one of the strongest months for sales in over two years but sales continue to run below the norms from pre-pandemic years. We think that improvements on the inventory front could help sales climb overtime. While inventories generally have been trending higher lately, there was a decline in inventories reported for December.</span></p>
