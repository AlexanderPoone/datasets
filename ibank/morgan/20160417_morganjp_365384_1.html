<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">Mar-16 Retail Sales Review</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall retail sales growth in Mar-16 slightly picked up over Jan&amp;Feb-15. </span><span class="font3">China’s Mar-16 retail sales recorded 10.5% y/y growth (Bloomberg consensus: 10.4%), slightly improving from the 10.2% y/y growth in Jan&amp;Feb-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jewelry sales sharply declined in Mar-16. </span><span class="font3">After a slight decline in Jan+Feb-16, gold &amp;&nbsp;jewelry sales further deteriorated to c9% decline in Mar-16, compared to c2% decline in Jan+Feb-16, cl 1% growth in Dec-15 and c5% growth in Nov-15. On a two year stack basis, gold &amp;&nbsp;jewelry sales increased c8% y/y in Mar-16, compared to 4% decline in Jan+Feb-16. The deterioration in gold &amp;&nbsp;jewelry sales is consistent with Chow Tai Fook’s sequentially weaker China SSSG in the 3 months to Mar-16. We note that gold price surged in the first quarter to over $1,250 levels from c$l,060 around December end. In addition, stablisation of RMB likely reduced the demand for gold, in our view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cosmetics sales grew c9% in Mar-16. </span><span class="font3">Cosmetics sales continued to be strong with c9% growth in Mar-16, compared to cl 1% in Jan+Feb-16, c6% y/y in Dec-15 and c9% in Nov-15. On a two year stack basis, cosmetics sales growth was c21% y/y in Mar-16 compared to c22% y/y in Jan+Feb-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clothing and footwear sales growth slowest in years. </span><span class="font3">Clothing and footwear sales growth slowed down to c4% in Mar-16 from c8% y/y growth in Jan+Feb-16. This is the slowest headline sales growth in recent years. On a two year stack basis, clothing and footwear sales rose cl9% in Mar-16 in line with cl8% in Jan+Feb-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ecommerce accounts for c 10.6% of overall retail sales in Mar-16. </span><span class="font3">Ecommerce sales were up c28% y/y in Mar-16. In terms of categories within e-commerce; food &amp;&nbsp;beverage, apparel &amp;&nbsp;footwear and others were up c36%, cl6% and c30%, respectively.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Stocks implications: </span><span class="font3">After the slowest Jan+Feb start in recent years, retail sales growth slightly improved in March. We believe the demand on the ground is still weak and we do not expect to see a meaningful recovery in 2016. We expect the deflationary environment witnessed over the past 2 years to persist. In staples, we expect to see slight improvement aided by less channel inventory as well as accelerated pace in product innovation and upgrade but competition might be a drag on some subsectors. Commentaries by staples companies indicate that IQ 16 trend has slightly improved. Given the general weak trend expected to continue in 2016, however, we suggest investors focus on bottom-up drivers and being selective in segments and stocks rather than having a top-down preference. We are pushing segments where we believe ongoing weakness is mostly cyclical and upside from structural factors remains, such as beer and home appliances. We also see opportunities in spirits where the gifting-related spending bubble seems to be out of the system and prices have stabilized. Our top picks are CRB, Hengan and Haier Electronics. We suggest avoiding WW given weak product innovation.</span></p>
