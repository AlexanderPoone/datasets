<p><span class="font4">Investment summary</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceuticals is an integrated healthcare sendee company which operates in all the verticals of the pharmaceutical industry including drug and medical devices development, manufacturing &amp;&nbsp;sales; hospital sendees; and pharmaceutical distribution (through its stakes in Sinopharm). It is a clear example of a healthcare ecosystem. As of 2015, 71% of Fosun’s revenue came from Pharmaceutical manufacturing, and Healthcare services accounted for 11%. Fosun's strength is its strong R&amp;D team and its continued heavy investment in development of new products. As of now, it has 172 products in its pipeline, especially in Biosimilar and Biologies segment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The hospital sendee segment is expected to grow at the highest rate in China primarily due to the Chinese government’s push to expand hospital coverage in the country. Fosun, being one of the first entrants in this market, made its debut by collaborating with Chindex, a premium private hospital chain, in 2012. After that Fosun continued to expand and expects to achieve a CAGR of 20% in 2016-2018 in terms of the number of beds by acquisition, which we have not yet priced in. Fosun is also a leader in the Medical devices business with its proprietaiy Da Vinci surgical robotic system. Apart from all these upsides, Fosun is also expanding internationally. For example, it acquired Alma in Israel in 2013 and Gland Pharm in India most recently, which creates upside from cooperation in R&amp;D cross selling and distribution channel expansion overseas. It has also ramped up its efforts to acquire high gross margin businesses and expand its business offering in the pharmaceutical segment.</span></p>
