<p><span class="font6">As the dust settles on the ZIRP capital allocation story, we look under the hood of the pipeline of companies coming and going from the IPO pipeline. Since the 2021 market peak we have gained 596 Unicorns. This nets against 155 lost - some to IPOs and SPACs, most to acquisition and re-marks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Key Takeaways</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;596 unicorns were added to the base unicorn number just shy of 800. Counterbalancing this, 155 were lost over this 2 year period.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$1.63 trillion was gained collectively from the aforementioned additions. This more than offset the $550bn Lost.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquisitions - amounting to 52 companies and $136bn of value acquired</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;De-horned unicorns - 47 unicorns representing $150bn of value fell below unicorn status when they returned to investors for further primary capital.</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font2">Using CBInsights' rolling tally of unicorns (private companies valued &gt;$1bn), we can measure the Latest herd relative to those that were valued above this Level at the peak of the market in 3Q 2021. The results are as follows:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Numbers: 596 unicorns were added to the base unicorn number just shy of 800. Counterbalancing this, 596 were added over this 2 year period. This yields a net figure as of November 2023 of 1230.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation: In value terms, $1.63 trillion was gained collectively from the aforementioned additions. This more than offset the $550bn Lost. The Latest figure has stepped up to &gt;$3trn; a 50% increase from just 2 years prior.</span></p></li></ul>
