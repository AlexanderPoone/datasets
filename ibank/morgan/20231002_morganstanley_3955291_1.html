<h4><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font7"><a name="bookmark5"></a>What's Next for the Bulks?</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">With our new price deck out Last week, we take a closer look at some of the key themes driving iron ore, met coal and thermal coal prices over the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Updated views: </span><span class="font2">In our new price deck released Last week, thermal coal is our top pick amongst bulk commodities, with risk-reward skewed to the upside into winter. We see iron ore and met coal well supported but acknowledge both are already at elevated levels and weak China steel mill margins may cap further upside. With a quiet news week ahead over China's Golden Week Holiday, we outline some of the key debates for the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Met coal: All about supply: </span><span class="font2">The speed and magnitude of met coal's price rise has taken markets by surprise. A combination of demand factors (stronger China steel output, a weaker monsoon season in India) and supply factors (suspensions in Queensland, safety inspections in China and uncertainty on Indonesia quotas) have contributed to the moves. In our view, the evolution of supply will be the key driver from here, and could keep prices well supported if disruptions continue. However, falling China steel margins could limit further price upside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Iron ore: Balancing act: </span><span class="font2">Iron ore is holding at $120/t with robust China steel output, strong blast furnace utilisation, falling port inventories, and weaker Chinese domestic iron ore output. However, the normal seasonal strength in supply is coming through from Australia and Brazil (Exhibit 13 ). From here, prices could soften modestly in Q4 (MSe $105/t) if China's steel production falls, either due to output cuts or in reaction to weak margins, with premiums for 65% Fe already fading. However, we would see a rebound into 1Q24 to $120/t, as China's steel output returns and El Nino brings supply risks to Australia and Brazil. Restocking ahead of the new year may even begin earlier, supporting prices on pullbacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Thermal coal: Positive skew into winter: </span><span class="font2">The expected slowdown in China's coal imports has not come through, and with northern hemisphere winter approaching, we see a positively skewed risk-reward for thermal coal. Coal remains more competitive than gas within Asia, Russian flows are coming under pressure due to logistical challenges and new export taxes, and Australia's shipments have been softer as well. This comes despite volumes to China almost doubling in recent months, with queues building at some ports. MSe $180/t for1Q24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">What we're watching: </span><span class="font2">For both met coal and iron ore, the trajectory of China's steel production is key for the demand side - steel output is up 2.3% YTD, but production would need to fall 12% from August Levels to come in flat YoY. On the supply side, thermal and met coal may be impacted by any slowdown in Russian shipments as new export tariffs kick in, squeezing margins with already challenging Logistics. Similarly, any delay to Indonesian coal output quotas could temporarily impact production. For met coal specifically, the duration of Queensland disruptions will also be important. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">See inside for more..</span></p>
