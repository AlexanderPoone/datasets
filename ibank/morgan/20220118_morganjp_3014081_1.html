<p><span class="font4">What We Learned from the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Last week, we hosted our 40th Annual J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference. We point to a sizeable amount of newsflow at the conference this year, with nearly half of our covered companies in attendance providing incremental updates. Our top takeaways from the conference include: 1) we remain bullish on Medicare Advantage as companies assuaged competition and margin concerns; 2) it remains too early to tell the Omicron impact on utilization and impact of commercial plans reimbursing for at-home COVID-19 tests; 3) companies sounded positive on direct contracting; 4) the sizeable FY21 guidance increase for CVS was an incremental near-term positive; 5) value-based care represents a key theme across our coverage universe; and 6) outside of CAH (which lowered guidance), most others noted that headwinds from supply chain, inflation and labor are already factored into the current outlook.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">We continue to believe the long-term fundamental outlook across our broader coverage universe remains intact. In our view, the presentations and meetings reaffirmed the key themes that have driven our broader sector and companyspecific views, including: value-based care, the consumer, utilization and capital deployment. Our covered companies underperformed the market, down 2.0% on average during the conference, vs. a 0.4% decrease in the S&amp;P 500. Sentiment is broadly mixed across the various sub-sectors within our coverage universe, ranging from very strong in the Rx Channel, to extremely weak for the Tech-Enabled Providers and Newly-Public Managed Care Companies within our coverage universe (although we remain positive on the longer-term fundamental outlook for many of those businesses). Beginning at 9am ET today, the J.P. Morgan U.S. Healthcare team will host a series of calls with takeaways from the conference (please contact us or your J.P. Morgan sales representative for details).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We remain bullish on Medicare Advantage, as companies assuage competition and margin concerns. </span><span class="font7">Importantly, we note that HUM clarified comments that it had made at a competitor conference the week prior, and note that the commentary around pricing was made in relation to the company’s own conservative pricing posture and was not meant to be inteip reted as a significant shift in the competitive landscape (the company reaffirmed its 4.5-5% long-term Individual MA margin target), and we believe the company’s comments regarding a focus on enterprise level margins are reflective of the increasing mix shift toward healthcare services. The view that MA competition generally remains rational was also corroborated by ALHC and CNC, both of which also have meaningful MA exposure. We were also encouraged by ALHC’s comment that discussion around potential cuts to Medicare Advantage has declined notably over the last few weeks.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too early to tell Omicron impact on utilization and impact of commercial plans reimbursing for at-home COVID-19 tests. </span><span class="font7">Commentary across the managed care companies was consistent that it was too early to tell how Omicron will impact 4Q21 and 1Q22. Companies generally saw an uptick in COVID-related inpatient admits in late December-early January as well as a corresponding decline in non-COVID inpatient utilization. It is too early to</span></p></li></ul>
