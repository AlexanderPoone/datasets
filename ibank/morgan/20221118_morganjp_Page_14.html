<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>The number of loan issuers downgraded in October were the most since May-20 and outpaced upgrades for the sixth consecutive month</span></h4>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratings trends for loans are not as favorable as for bond issuers. In fact, October’s # of loan issuers downgraded (34) exceeded upgrades (13) for a sixth consecutive month. October also included the most downgraded issuers May 2020. </span><span class="font6">For context. May, June, July, August, September and October are the first-time downgraded loan issuers exceeded upgrades since November 2020. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Notably, October saw the least number of issuers and amount of upgrades and the most number of issuers and amount of downgrades since May 2020. The 2022 upgrade-to-downgrade ratio stands at 0.77:1, which compares to 2.00:1 in 2021 and 0.29:1 in 2020. This also sits in contrast to rating agency trends in high-yield bonds where upgrades easily surpass downgrades in 2022 with a ratio of 1.69:1. </span><span class="font6">Since the beginning of 2021 there are 583 companies upgraded totaling $530bn, which compares to 449 companies downgraded totaling $405bn. Note the 640 loan issuers downgraded in 2020 indicated 47% of 13 51 issuers were downgraded. In other words, more than 90% of 2020’s downgrades have transitioned to upgrades since the beginning of 2021.</span></p>
