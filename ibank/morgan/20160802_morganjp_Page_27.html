<p><span class="font3">CP has actually de-leveraged since 2012 with net-gearing falling substantially in FY13 to 17% from 42% the prior year after the company disposed of its 21.8% equity interest in CIMC for a cash consideration of US$1.22B. In the following year, CP saw its adjusted OCF (adjusted for dividends received from JCEs and Associates) to capex coverage rise above lx as the company had limited capex spending, resulting in gearing falling further. However, we observed an increase in net gearing in FYI 5 and forecast this to rise back to c40% in FYI 6/17E on the back of a more active acquisition program, which is in line with management's guidance for this year's spending as well as near term acquisition pipeline.</span></p>
