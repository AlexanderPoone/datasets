<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Lifestyle to spin off China business for separate listing</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Lifestyle announced it would spin off its China businesses for a separate listing on the HK Stock Exchange and on 22 April 2016, Lifestyle China had submitted the listing application. As the remaining Lifestyle (Lifestyle HK) intends to distribute all issued shares in Lifestyle China by introduction to qualifying shareholders, Lifestyle China will cease lobe a subsidiary of Lifestyle HK. After the spin-off, Lifestyle HK will focus on two HK SOGO department stores in Causeway Bay and Tsim Sha Tsui while Lifestyle China will operate businesses in China including department stores (Jiuguang), supermarkets and restaurants. The announcement highlighted the spin-off can increase the financial transparency of the two entities within two geographies, and can also offer investors options with regard to different growth paths and investment opportunities. The announcement did not disclose the details about the balance sheet of the two entities or the timeframe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe this is a positive move to the remaining Lifestyle (Lifestyle HK) in the short to medium term given the HK business is stable, contributes the majority of the profits to the current Group (c80% or net profit in FYI 5) and more importantly, its cash flow will not be dragged down by the ongoing investment project in China and thus has upside potential for higher dividend payouts. On the other hand, Lifestyle China is more volatile due to the tough competition landscape; besides, in the near term it requires higher capex investments (Rmbl.2bn in FY16 and Rmbl.5bn in FY17) for its investment project of a commercial complex in Shanghai Daning which is expected to complete in 2018. We have no details regarding how will the Group split the balance sheet, but we believe the cost pressure on Lifestyle China will likely increase post the spin-off without support from the solid HK business. In our model, we expect Lifestyle HK to deliver 6% earnings growth in FYI 6 with both Causeway Bay and TST being profitable. For Lifestyle China, if we exclude the disposal of Shenyang store in Dec 2015, we expect like-for-like earnings to grow 8% in FY 16 thanks to a narrowing loss in the Dalian store and decent momentum in the Suzhou store, while the Shanghai store and Bairen JV remain stable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our SOTP valuation suggests the targeted PT of Lifestyle HK at HK$11.2 with 1 lx one year forward earnings multiple. We value Lifestyle China at HK$2.4 based on lOx one year forward earnings. We remain OW on the remaining Lifestyle (Lifestyle HK) given it is relatively resilient in our department store coverage given the consumption spend in the core CWB store is largely driven by local customers (&gt;60%) rather than Chinese tourists and the TST store has continued to see improved merchandising. And after the spin-off, we would expect potential upside to the dividend payout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We reiterate OW given the relatively protected HK business (vs remaining HK retailers) and property ownership.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Jun-17 PT of HKS 13.6 is based on our SOTP valuation, in which wc value the HK operation at 11 x and the mainland operation at l()x P/E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Key downside risks to our rating and price target include a sudden weakening in performance at the Shanghai store, an unexpected slowdown at the HK store, and higher-than-expected losses at the Dalian store.</span></p>
