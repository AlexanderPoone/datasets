<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Relationship to end users</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">End users vary in the size of their internal engineering staff and their use of outside system integrators. Some manufacturing companies prefer to do all their own project integration, while others handle only small projects internally, and some outsource nearly everything. This choice would depend on the size of the company and the technical requirements associated with a particular project. We believe there is a trend toward the greater use of independent system integrators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Relationship to suppliers</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The interaction with suppliers is more nuanced, as system integrators can be both a customer and/or a competitor. From the perspective of equipment sales, system integrators are a key sales channel (we estimate these firms account for $5-1 OB in equipment purchases globally), and automation vendors have made increasing efforts to market their products to them. Although the equipment brand used on a given project is sometimes dictated by the end user, an integrator can play an important role in selecting the equipment used and may lead with the technology of a preferred supplier. At the same time, however, the internal engineering arms of OEMs will sometimes compete head-to-head with system integrators on bids, typically on larger projects where there is a significant amount of equipment revenue to be won.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">End market and product focus</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">System integrators are present across every automation end market, and nearly every sector of the industrial economy. Although there is no widely accepted data on the end market breakout of system integrators’ revenue, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Control Engineering Magazine </span><span class="font2">provides an estimate that we reference below. Importantly, the end markets here utilize a broad range of discrete, process, and batch/hybrid applications.</span></p>
