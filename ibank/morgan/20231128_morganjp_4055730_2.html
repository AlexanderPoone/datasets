<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across base metals markets, the estimated open interest value decreased modestly to $141 billion WOW, the lowest in 4 weeks (24 Nov, Figu re 9). The decline in total open interest was mainly driven by contract-based outflows of $1 billion, mainly from copper and nickel. Overall, base metals open interest has remained in a range between $140-$160 billion over 21123 and our strategists broadly </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">expect the sector to remain s</span><span class="font1">tuck in neutral for the majority of 2024. Risk is likely skewed to the downside around mid-year 2024 as the US economy is expected to </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">walk the line </span><span class="font1">between expansion and contraction, while a sustained recovery is on hold until exChinese demand rebounds,though this still looks u nlikely until late-2024 and 2 025.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated value of open interest across environmental markets increased by 2% WOW to $88 billion (24 Nov, Figure 7). Contract-based net inflows were $1.5 billion W OW, absorbed by EUAs. Investment funds have reduced their net short position across EUAs for the first time in five weeks, net lengthening the position by 2.6k lots over the week to -31k lots overall (as of 17 Nov).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global agricultural market estimated open interest value decreased 2% WOW to -$318 billion (24 Nov, Figure 10, Figure 14). Contract-based outflows over the week totaled -$2.2 billion for the sector as a w hole, driven by outflows from grains and oilseeds markets. </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">UNTCAs report for the first half of November</span><span class="font1"> indicated C/S Brazil fortnight sugar mix at 49.8%, with cumulative figure of 49.4%. Sugar production for MY 2023/24 remains historically high at 39.4 million tonnes tq, marking a 23% YOY rise. The latest fori night's production reached 2.2 million tonnes tq, a 31% YOYincrease.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Price momentum generally declined across energy and agri markets bu t increased across base and precious metals over the week (24 Nov, Figure 17, Table 2). Notably, the short-term lookback trading signal on NYMEX Platinum and LME Copper sw itched from a sell-to-buy signal. The long-term and short-term lookback trading signals on CBOT Soybeans are approaching a buy-to-sell trading signal switch.</span></p></li>
