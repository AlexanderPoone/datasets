<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Job growth was solid in December (216,000) with u n employ me nt rate holding at 3.7%</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOMC minutes suggested rate cuts could come later this year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to think first Fed cut occurs in June</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December CPI forecast: headline: 0.2%, core 0.3%</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">We continue to think that the FOMC will start lowering rates in June, with the news from the past week supporting the idea that a rate cut could come fairly soon, but probably not as early as the first quarter. Most importantly, the December employment report sho wed solid job growth continuing through the fourth quarter, with a still-tight labor market generating upward pressure on wages. The broad trend in employment growth (and aggregate hours growth and average hourly earnings growth) still appears to be moderating over time, but so far this looks like a shift to a more balanced labor market following the severe effects of the pandemic, and not a labor market that has particularly weak demand for workers. Several other labor market reports echoed this message lately (e.g., job openings continued to trend lower into November but remain higher than pre-pandemic norms), although there was a curiously dow nbeat reading on employment in the ISM services survey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Signsofa more balanced labor market and reduced inflation pressures are leading to speculation about when the FOMC will start to lower rates. The minutes to the December FOMC meeting didn't surprise in a meaningful way and didn't suggest that rate cuts were imminent. They confirmed that the Committee sees rates “at or near” the peak for the cycle. While “almost all participants” thought the improved inflation outlook means rate cuts this year, they are still far from guessing when those cuts might start. The minutes did suggest that we should start to see more discussion of plans for the balance sheet soon, and we think this could start to occur at the late-January meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Inflation remains a key issue for policymakers and next week’s December CPI report w ill be important to watch. We forecast that the headline CPI w ill be up 0.2%, w ith a 0.26% gain for the core index. While this wouldn’t be a particularly soft print for the core measure, we believe the related year-ago rate w ill continue to moderate (moving from 4.0%oya in November to 3.8% in December) and we expect additional cooling over time. This upcoming CPI report likely w ill be the last main economic release ahead of the late-January FOMC meeting, but there will be plenty of other news before that meeting as well.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Job growth still solid</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Nonfarm employment beat expectations in December, increasing 216,000, although after downward revisions of 71,000 to prior months the level of employment came in close to wliat was anticipated. There were also mixed messages from the other details of the report. In the establishment survey, average hourly earnings increased a solid 0.4%, but the average workweek ticked down to 34.3 hours. In the household survey, the unemployment rate held unchanged at a low 3.7%, but the labor force participation rate slumped three-tenths to 62.5% and the volatile household measure of employment plunged 683,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Stepping back, labor demand has been gradually cooling. Job growth averaged 165,000 in the fourth quarter, the weakest quarter of the expansion though still above what’s required to meet the growth in the population (Figure 1). Similarly, wages grew at a 3.7% annual rate last quarter, the weakest pace since late 2020 though still probably a little too hot from a labor cost and inflation perspective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The more lagging JOLTS data also suggest that labor demand is cooling but remaining solid. Job openings continued their recent dow nw ard trend into November. But while the number of job openings has fallen by more than 3mn since the all-time high reported for March 2022, the November level of openings was still up by more than 1 mn from the strongest month of 2019 (Figure 2). While hiring has slowed lately,</span></p>
