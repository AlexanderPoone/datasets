<p><span class="font6">Since publisliing earlier this week, we are providing more detailed balances that now address our assumptions for freeze-offs by region. We have additionally increased our assumption for freeze-offs impacting production to -3.5 Bcf day for January. This is a -2.5 Bcf day revision higher than what our balance reflected earlier this week. Additionally, we have incorporated in this balance updated January weather of 918 HDDs, now virtually flatto our 10-y ear normal. Our end-March 2024 storage trajectory is -1.9 Tcf and our end-October 2024 storage trajectory is -3.92 Tcf assuming normal weather after January.</span></p>

There may be some incremental feedgas needed for this process, but if history were a guide we would assume that this still puts the facility on pace for increased feedgas flows for LNG production by 4Q24. As a reminder, our current lower-48 balance incorporates Golden Pass feedgas flows commencing in 4Q24. </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">In our balances of Southeast US, (representing Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana) reflects only the addition to of Plaqueminesfeedgas demand to consume additional gas in the region. We have made a conservative assumption that Golden Pass maybe able to access flows from Texas and therefore its pull on the Southeast balance is not included. We do not believe thatflows will actually manifest this way but it is meant to h ighlightjust h ow tight the region al balance can be with just on cfacility online, the driver of our bullish 2025 price narrative.</span></p>
