<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Valuation Methodology and Risks</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">0006.HK; PT: HKS75.00</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our preferred valuation approach: Sum-of-the-parts</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As PAH has invested in various energy projects globally (including regulated assets and unregulated assets), our preferred approach to valuing PAH is sum-of-the-parts. Our valuation consists of three parts as below:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Listed assets: Hong Kong Electric Investments. We value H KEI using market price of H K$5.54 as of September 18, 2015.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Australia / UK/Canada / New Zealand: Power, Gas and Energy from Waste Assets: We value the three regulated electricity distribution companies in Australia, the UK power, gas companies, the power asset in Canada and the electricity distribution networks in New Zealand using a discounted cash flow (DCF) model, reflecting the longterm and stable expected return on assets under its regulation. We use an equity discount rate of 7% for UK assets and 8% for assets in other regions(vs. previous 10.3%), given lower allowed return of the regulated assets in most cases due to lower interest cost Our DCF terminal growth assumption for the business in Australia, UK, Canada and New Zealand is 0%, given the stable operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chinese/Indian Power Plants: We value PAH's Chinese /Indian Power Plants using a DCF model. We use an equity discount rate of 12% to reflect the unregulated return nature of the business, given more risks vs. regulated assets. We assume terminal growth of 0% for power plants, given the stable operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Upside Risks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Successful bid for new assets in overseas markets, mainly driven by the joint development with Cheung Kong Infrastructure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Currency appreciation against the Hong Kong dollar</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Downside Risks:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Disappointment in operations and financial performance of its overseas businesses</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lack of high-quality overseas investment opportunities</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2</span></p>
