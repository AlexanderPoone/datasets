<p><span class="font4">4Q Preview: Expect Strong Results/Guidance; Fundamental Set Up Remains Strong for 2022</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">As we start the new year, we believe that the fundamental set up that drove outsized rev/EPS growth and stock performance for semi conductor/semi equipment companies in 2021 remains largely intact with global GDP set to grow 4%+ in 2022, and providing solid macro underpinnings for continued end demand strength: acceleration in cloud/data center capex (top 4 US CSPs up 30% Y/Y), resumption of 5G infrastructure expansion globally, continued 5G smartphone adoption (units up 40%+ Y/Y), recovery in auto production (up 9.5% in 2022), the reemergence of commercial/enterprise PCs (+3% Y/Y in 2022 following +10% in 2021), and resurgence of custom chip (ASIC) programs (12-15% CAGR). Layered on top of the solid demand environment is a persistent supply constraint dynamic that remains extended (into 2023) and has pushed unfulfilled demand into this year and should drive continued pricing power/margin expansion for our companies. Looking into the upcoming 4Q earnings season, we expect Dec-Q revenues/EPS for most of our covered companies to come in above consensus expectations as a seasonally stronger period was bolstered by the aforementioned demand growth drivers and pricing power. As for March-Q outlooks, we expect better than consensus revenue'EPS as broadbased demand strength (with solid cloud datacenter enteiprise spending, PC production/demand improvements, 5G infrastructure spending, and auto production recovery continuing to gain momentum) and moderately improving supply dynamics offset a seasonally softer period. Overall, this is in-line with our recent CES conference takeaways (see note </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font7">), where most of the companies in attendance indicated that book-to-bill remains strong, supply has yet to catch up to demand, and the supplydemand gap will likely remain at least through the end of CY22. We estimate that semi companies are still shipping 20-30% below current market demand and should extend semiconductor/semi cap revenue/EPS expansion through 2022 and likely into 2023. On the supply side, inventory levels in the distribution channel remains at historic lows and companies are not seeing any signs of cancellations, pushouts, or rescheduling of the current backlog. We acknowledged elevated semi/customer inventories in certain end-markets, however, when overlaying this on actual end-market inventories/demand, we believe there’s still a significant amount of catch-up by semiconductor companies to get back to more normalized levels. Regarding stock performance, the SOX was up -41% in 2021 (outperfonning the S&amp;P 500 by -1400bps and the NASDAQ by -1900bps). YTD, stocks are down 8% and discounting a more aggressive Fed/interest rate environment, however once the stocks discount this we anticipate the market focusing back on segment fundamentals and expect continued outperformance in 2022 as the market discounts positive Y/Y growth trends and positive EPS revisions through 2022 and into 2023 (recall there were three 10%+ pull-backs in 2021 and stocks snapped-back in all three periods given the strong demand environment). Our top overall semiconductor picks remain AV GO and MRVL (strong cloud netw orking compute acceleration semiconductor exposure, 5G networking exposure via ASIC/optical segments, and strong storage trends), and our top semicap pick continues to be KLAC. We also favor OW-rated INTO, NV DA, MU on outsized exposure to cloud datacenter spending trends. On the broad-based semi side, we favor OW-rated GFS, MCHP, and ADI as global demand trends continue to drive improvements in industrial auto demand. In addition to KLAC, we also favor the other semicap names (OW LRCX, OW AMAT) as the focus on capacity expansion and continued technology migrations remain as strong tailwinds.</span></p>
