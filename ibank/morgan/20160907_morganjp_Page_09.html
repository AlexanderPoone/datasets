<p><span class="font2">Fosun Pharma has invested heavily and established rich innovative drugs and biosimilar products pipelines, which we believe offer significant long term growth potential and is under-appreciated by many investors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fosun has set up dedicated teams in China and the US to develop small-molecule chemical drugs and large-molecule biologic products, such as monoclonal. In April 2014, it received clinical trial approval from the CFDA for the rituximab monoclonal antibody genetic drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fosun has been also focusing on the R&amp;D of large molecule biologic &amp;&nbsp;biosimiliar drugs with great growth potential, in our view. For example, its JV Shanghai Chemo Wanbang Biopharm has three marketed products: rh-EPO (brand name: CLONEPO), r-streptokinase (brand name: CICLEADON®), and rh-interferon y (brand name: CLONGAMMA®). Henlius Biotech is focused on biosimilar and bio betters (mAbs and recombinant proteins) for cancer and autoimmune diseases. Henlius’s rituximab biosimilar is under CFDA review for clinical trials to treat RA and lymphoma. Fosun has also filed an IND application for its trastuzumab biosimilar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Furthermore, in 2015 Fosun Pharma, HOPU Investments, China Everbright Limited and WuXi PharmaTech jointly acquired Ambrx, a clinical-stage Biotechnology company, focused on discovering and developing optimized protein therapeutics with cutting edge site-specific bio-conjugates technology platform. In Jan 2015, it acquired approximately 35.23% equity interest in Gene first Limited, a U.K. company principally engaged in developing and manufacturing molecular diagnostic products for infectious diseases and cancer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1H16, Fosun spent RMB307mn in R&amp;D, accounting for 4% of revenue and up 3% as compared to 1H15. Out of this RMB243mn was spent in pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&amp;D, or 5% of total pharma sales. The main focus of Fosun in R&amp;D is the development of small molecular innovative drugs, large-molecular biologies, high value generics and specialized formulation technology. Fosun obtained clonocal trial approval for 22 products in 1H16. Also, N-Acetyl Cysteine, Histidine hydrochloride APIs, Fasudil Hydrochloride APIs and therm opentinfor injection approved production approval.</span></p>
