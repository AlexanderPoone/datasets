<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">November’s rally in leveraged loan prices slowed over the past week amid a focus on earnings and the most active primary market since early June. Leveraged loan prices increased +$0.05 over the past week to $93.22 and are now $1.20 above early July’s year-to-date low </span><span class="font3">with the average price for BB loans increasing $0.13 to $97.58, while Single B loan prices increased $0.17 to $93.16 and Split B/CCC loan prices decreased $0.61 to $75.64. Meanwhile, leveraged loan yields decreased Ibp and spreads to maturity remained unchanged over the past week to 9.79% and 575bp, which are down 49bp and 22bp month-to-date and are now 10.66% and 636bp to a 3yr takeout. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Leveraged Loan index is providing a +1.17% gain in November with B (+1.53%) outperforming BB (+1.13%) and CCC (-0.34%) performance. Notably, loans are providing their 3<sup>rd</sup> best monthly return since Jan 2021 and is on track to be the 4<sup>th</sup> best November on record. </span><span class="font3">Loans are also outperforming HY bonds by 50bp month-to-date. Bl, B2, B3, and Caal loans are providing returns month-to-date of+1.30%, +1.56%, +1.46%, and -0.88%, respectively. For context, Bl, B2, B3, and Caal loans are providing returns year-to-date of +0.60%, -1.45%, -3.26%, and -11.69%, respectively. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Using Moody’s, meanwhile, BB, B1/B2, B3, and CCC loans have a spread to maturity of 340bp, 551bp, 793bp, and 1772bp, respectively. A couple of relationships stand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One, the B1ZB2 spread versus BB loans of 210bp is comfortably above the past 12Ms and non-recessionary averages of 152bp and 126bp, respectively. Second, CCC loans, which trade 979bp wide of B3 loans are pricing in a recession (see table). </span><span class="font3">Given we expect a downgrade wave and build in the CCC loan universe, the current cohort of B3 loans should underperform amid hindered demand conditions. Notably, CCC loan spreads are already at a high since June 2020. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Year-to-date, the Leveraged Loan index is providing a -0.57% loss </span><span class="font3">with BB (+2.23%) and B loans (-1.20%) outperforming CCC loans (-13.01%). There is a lot of dispersion by sector year-to-date with Energy (+5.61%) and Utility (+3.89%) outperforming and Consumer Products (-5.10%) and Metals/Mining (-4.05%) underperforming. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">For context, this compares to YTD losses for HY (10.77%), IG (-16.37%), and the S&amp;P 500 (-16.02%). </span><span class="font3">Meanwhile, the CLO primary has priced $4.8bn month-to-date following $8.7bn of ex-re fi/resets in October; year-to-date activity of $118.4bn is down -16% vs a year ago. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Lastly, 5 deals priced this week for $8.0bn, the highest weekly issuance since the week ending 6/10 and boosting November’s loan issuance to $14.8bn, which is the highest monthly issuance since June. </span><span class="font3">As such</span></p>
