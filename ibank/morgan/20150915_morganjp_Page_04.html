<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Other conference call snippets</span></h5>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Prada brand strategy; elevation and innovation. </span><span class="font3">Management commented that in the last 18 months they have moved their products to higher price points such that c.20% of sales is now in the in price range in excess of €1,700. Such elevation is expected to continue with Prada having started introducing new more innovative, luxurious, detailed and higher priced products in July and are continuing to do so in September and October, commenting that “we will have a number of new products hitting the stores between today and six months... it will certainly make a difference in terms of the product offering we’ll be presenting vis-à-vis the previous months.” Prada seemed confident in the success of the upcoming products commenting “we will certainly be able to start new demand for this product because they're obviously they're very special and peculiar.” We are not yet convinced of the success of Prada’s new product launches, and are of the view that Prada’s relatively more cautious comments on current trading are likely accentuated by products not yet agreeing with the consumer. Moreover, management commented on the call that higher pricing has not yet had an impact on GM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Inventory levels elevated. </span><span class="font3">Inventories in Hl were +44% yoy with finished goods +48% yoy within this, likely driven by upcoming product launches discussed above. Indeed on the call management commented that they “are working to take out products that we have in the stock house and at the same time launch new products. This is what we are doing, reduce inventory and launch new products.” Hence they do not expect to increase mark-down level activity H2 as a consequence of excess inventory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Supply chain efficiencies </span><span class="font3">were the buzz-words throughout the call. Prada commented on work they have done on supply management in terms of factories, logistics, product development and production that enable the more the speedy reaction to market situation and market change. Indeed it is these supply chain efficiencies that helped drive impressive GM expansion in Q2.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">HK rents an ongoing conversation. </span><span class="font3">Prada commented on the call that HK landlords remain tough but cannot be unreasonable forever. Prada management stated they think landlords will co-operate in time as they do not wish for luxury names to walk away from stores. This is in line with what we have been hearing from the sector, with luxury companies having little meaningful progress so far, with at most some managing to change fixed rate rents to variable rents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Macau still dire. </span><span class="font3">Interesting to hear management relatively more confident on the outlook of HK rather than Macau, noting that if they had to bet on the turn-around of one, they’d bet on HK. Prada noted that the performance of Macau is very much related to the return of high-end spenders, with glimmers of uplift in family visitors not a source of alleviation for luxury sales declines.</span></p>
