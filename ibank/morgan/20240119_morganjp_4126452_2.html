Meanwhile initial claims moved down by 16k to 187k, the lowest level since September 2022 (Figu re 1 ), and while oureconomists are loathe to read too much into a single dataprint, the broad trend lower in filings frames a robust labor market (see </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">CS.-</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Initial claims look upbeat again</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font3"> Daniel Silver, 1/18/24). Turning to Fedspeak, a number of FOMC participants, including Pres. Mester (Civ., v.) and Bostic (Atl., v.), pushed back on market expectations for a March rate cut as they want to see more progress on inflation. Notably Pres. Williams (NY., v.) argued for maintaining a restrictive stance for‘some time’ while Gov. Waller(2030) advocated for cutting ratesmore ‘methodically and carefully than in prior cycles as current economic strength affords a more cautious easing timeline (se </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Economics)</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Figure 2: The broad curve is trading near its steepest levels of the last 18 months</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nonetheless, the front end of the rates curve has remained remarkably well anchored: OIS forwards are pricing in approximately a 50% probability of a 25bp ease in March, less dovish than two weeks ago, but are still pricing in more than 130bp of easing this year. The front end has been relatively insulated from the sell off, in our minds, because both the December FOMC meeting, as well as the minutesof this meeting, have indicated that the Fed has made clear progress toward its inflation target, and that the next move is likely to be an ease. Meanwhile, stronger economic data havebiased longer-maturity Treasuries higher, with the broad curve reaching its steepest levels since early summer 2022 (Figure 2). Looking ahead, we recommend adding 5-year duration longs, given the considerable backup in yields from their late 2023 lows, an expectation that TIPS breakevens will reverse lower, and a more favorable technical backdrop. According to our Treasury Client Survey, net long duration positions have been reduced, while the share of neutrals has risen to its highest level since May 2023. Additionally, despite the steepening observed in recent weeks, we maintain 5s/30s curve steepeners, as the curve still appears too flat after adjusting for its drivers, and the curve tends to steepen as markets transition from Fed tightening to easing (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Treasuries</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Turning to inflation markets, 10-year TIPS breakevens have widened nearly 1 Ibp, net of carry, since reaching local lows late last year, moving back to their widest levels since early November. This move has occurred even as our broad commodities index has declined, leaving 10-year breakevens appearing nearly 20bp too wide versus our fair value model.
