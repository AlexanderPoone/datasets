<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">. Impending Liquidity' Storm</span><span class="font3">-Tighter global liquidity negatively impacts all risk assets, emerging and developed (Figure 6). Liquidity expected to tighten: (i) in the US via rebuilding of the Treasury General Account (new development) to ~US$650bn post debt ceiling resolution and simultaneous Fed QT (expected); and (ii) globally, via ongoing contraction of central bank balance sheets (expected). Among the two, J.P. Morgan FX team forecasts the latter will have a larger impact on USD (</span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font3">). In combination with recent cooling in growth, this should allow the dollar to freely respond to late-cycle concerns. A stronger USD has predominantly been associated with weaker ASEAN equities. During periods of broad USD rally by 5% over the past 20 years, average net outflows (Figure 9) were seen in Thailand (-US$1.8bn), Malaysia (-US$1.6bn), Indonesia (-US$671 mn), the Philippines (-US$251 mn), Singapore (-US$201 mn) and Vietnam (-US$1 Omn).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Foreign investors sold off </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thai equities </span><span class="font3">heavily in May (-US$967mn), followed by prop traders (-US$49mn), outflows were offset by a surge in local institution buying (+US $880mn), and slight increase in local retail exposure (+US$ 136mn).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Malaysia </span><span class="font3">recorded RM0.8bn (US$159mn) net outflow in May 2023 compared to a net outflowofRM0.3bn(US$56mn) in April 2023. Malaysia’s bond market recorded 0.6% M/M net foreign inflow in April 2023. Foreign holdings of MGS decreased by RM1.6bn M/M to RM 194bn, which is equivalent to 36.0% of total outstanding MGS. YTD net equity outflows are US$63 8mn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Philippines </span><span class="font3">equities ended May with net foreign outflows of US$8 Imn, following the April net inflows of US$34mn. MSCI quarterly index review saw a net outflow of US$237mn, close to 3x the market’s average daily turnover. YTD net equity outflows are US$565mn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vietnam </span><span class="font3">witnessed net outflows US$ 119mn in May, reversing all inflows seen year to date. Allocation by AxJ and EM funds to Vietnam remains 0.4% and 0.8% in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In May, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Indonesian </span><span class="font3">equities saw inflows of US$109mn, following the April inflows of US $828mn. YTD net equity inflows are US$ 1,383mn, highest within ASEAN. In ourview, this resilience is supported by (1) Resilient GDPgrowth that underpin earnings outlook, (2)IDR strength from CA surplus, and (3) MSCI rebalancing lead to passive inflows to Indonesia (link).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Net foreign flows turned negative for </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Singapore </span><span class="font3">equities in April (US$102mn) after three consecutive month of inflows. Outflows were driven by AxJ (net UW increase to 40bps vs 22bps in March) and global (net OW reduced to 27bps vs. 33bps in March) funds trimming Singapore exposure. Most of the buying in recent months is driven by retail investors (+S $4.2bn YTD), offsetting strong outflows of institutional investors (-S$ 3.6bn) from Singapore equities.</span></p>
