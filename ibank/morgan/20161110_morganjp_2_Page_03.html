<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Highlights from the analyst briefing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ELP sales growth due to LF- </span><span class="font3">ELP sales for 1HFY17 were up 20% Y/Y to $366m but excluding the LF acquisition, sales were flat in 1HFY17 compared to 1HFY16. We do not expect significant organic growth in ELP sales until after the two operations are fully integrated by the end of FYI 7 and the majority of LF production is moved in-house.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Telecom sales disappoint - </span><span class="font3">Telecom-related sales (phones, baby monitors, conference equipment, headsets) fell 12% Y/Y in 1HFY17 globally with the weakest market Europe down 15% Y/Y due mainly to the drop in demand from many telcos in Europe as they adjusted inventories and the number of landlines decreases. On the bright side, non-residential cordless phones products continue to grow nicely. These include new commercial products such as office conferencing equipment, baby monitors and wireless Bluetooth headsets. While these non-cordless phone products make up only 30-35% of the telecom division, their growth is key to offsetting the decline in cordless phones used in the home. Vtech did acquire telecom equipment maker SNOM in 2HFY17 for USS 15m and this acquisition should boost overall non-cordless residential phone products to close to 45-50% by FYI 8, in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">CMS has patchy performance - </span><span class="font3">Overall CMS sales grew 11 %in 1HFY17 Y/Y which is close to our expectations of 12%. Europe was very strong and grew 20% Y/Y on the back of new products (hearing aids and ultrasound) but North American sales fell 7% Y/Y in 1HFY17 due to the decline in audio visual equipment. Overall CMS operations were reasonable and we expect this type of growth to continue in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">LF integration front-end loaded- </span><span class="font3">VTech has mentioned before that FY17 was a year of integration and restructuring of LF and that FYI 8 would be a normal operating year with all of the production brought in-house and management is reasonably optimistic for losses to end in FYI 8. However, much work has to be done in FYI 7 and management mentioned that most of the restructuring related costs had been incurred and work done in 1HFY17. We are hopeful that most of the restructuring has been done but we still factor in LF to generate an additional $ 1 Om loss in2HFY17.</span></p>
