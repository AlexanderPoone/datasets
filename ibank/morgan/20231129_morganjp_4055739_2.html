<p><span class="font0">The weight of the world: Updated to 2022</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">29 November 2023</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">third-, fourth-, and fifth-largest gains in nominal GDP share in 2022—firmed modestly in the 0.3%-pt to 0.1%-pt range. The China weight declined 0.4%-pt from 2021 to 202 2 after gaining the most ground over the prior two years. Taking a longer view, the contrast between the two largest economies by GDP weight (the US and China) and the rest of the world is clear. The China weight has outpaced the US gain since 2019, rising 2.1%-pts over that period despite moving modestly lower in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">By contrast, Western Europe and Japan delivered much weaker performance in 2022. The Euro area lost the most from 2021 to 202 2, with its weight dropping 1.1%-pt (the UK also saw its weight move lower by 0.3%-pt). Japan followed with a global GDP share decline of 1.0%-pt from 2021 to 2022 as the value of the yen slumped against the USD (Figure 3). The combined weight loss of the these three DM economies since 2019 accounts for the entirety of the US and China’s weight gain over the same period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the US weight rebounded in 2022 after moving lower in 2021, the underlying trend looks more structural for the Euro area and Japan. Both have seen their influence diminished on the global stage over the past decade. This trend continued in 2022 as last year’s most unanticipated shock—Russia’s invasion of Ukraine—was most acute in Europe due to its dependence on Russian natural gas supply. As a result the Euro area weight continued to deteriorate in 2022 (Figure 4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Back to business as usual for the EM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Despite a rare decline in China’s share of global GDP last year (its first step back since 1994), the EM share of global output gained 0.7%-pt from 2021 to 2022. The rise in the EM weight last year was roughly half the size of its gain in 2021, when China’s weight alone grew more than a full %-pt. From 2014 to 2020, the EM as a whole stalled in gaining on the DM after the sustained rapid increase of EM’s share of global output over the previous two decades (Figure 5). The DM weight ticked up in 2020 for the first time since 2016 and only the fourth time in the past two decades. However, the EM weight has climbed 2.2%-pts since 2020. Much of the gain since 2000 can be credited to China, but a number of smaller EMs have also ascended in the rankings. Growth in China last year was held back by strict adherence to its zero-COVID policy, resulting in a lack of immunity via infection and lockdowns that stifled activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the 0.7%-pt weight gain for the EM last year marked a second consecutive annual increase of EM’s share of global output, the pace of convergence has moderated significantly in recent years. Gains in the EM have slowed from 1.9%-pts on average per year between 2005 and 2013 to just 0.5%-pt per year between 2014 and 2022. The EM has been buffeted by headwinds in recent years, namely a credit overhang and the commodity price collapse in 2014-15. Moreover, China— the immediate driver of EM’s share increase—has seen potential growth downshift owing to structural factors. That said,</span></p>
