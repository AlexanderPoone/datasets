<p><span class="font2">Goodbye Hard Times, Hello Great Expectations?</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The events of this year will continue to reverberate in the next. The regional banking crisis has likely shifted the reaction function of banks, causing them to prioritize liquidity-build and capital conservation and shun duration risk in AFS portfolios. Securities demand frombankswill likely remain weak, only pickingup later in2024 ifAOCI gains materialize in 1Q24 and 2Q24</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The broader supply-demand picture is also weak as marginal buyers of USTs are all price-sensitive, but there are offsets. Treasury’s recent willingness to modify issuance in response to market conditions opens the door to supply-side adjustments. Also, portfolio aging is a somewhat under-appreciated source of duration demand, given differences in aging between portfolios and benchmarks. That said, the backdrop is favorable for term premium to remain elevated in the coming year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stickiness of Reserves should sustain QT throughout 2024, causing the Fed’s balance sheet to decline by-$1.2tn by YE24, with Reserves &amp;&nbsp;RRPdeclining by ~$450bn and -$750bn. This decline in the RRP, along with falling forward OIS as we head towards rate cuts in 2H24, should pressure 2-year swap spreads narrower</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long end swap spreads are too wide to fair value and could narrow in the near term before drifting modestly wider in 1H24. Given that spreads are now much wider than even our mid-year projection, and given the sensitivity of long end swap spreads to an equity market selloff (because of its impact on duration demand from VA hedgers), we see 30-year swap spread narrowers as an attractive way to position for recession risk even though such an equity selloff is not our baseline view</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap spreads in thebelly are likely biased wider, but largely becauseofcurrently narrow valuations. Given this, and given the fact that most other factors point to narrowing, we look for the 5s/10s swap spread curve to flatten in coming months</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look for the swap curve to be biased steeper in the year ahead, on the back of a slowing economy and the approach ofpolicy easing in 2H24, with termpremium considerations lending additional support on the margin. Forward curves and spot curves anchored in the belly and beyond are likely the best sectors for outright steepeners</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are good reasons to not include termpremium as an explicit factor in yield curve fair value models, but such non-inclusion is not a denial of its importance in 2024. We d evi se a simp le Te rm P re miu m Exposure I nd ex fo r eac h yield curve, that helps to enable trades designed to isolate exposure to term premium as well as other “term-premium-aware” yield curve trading strategies, such as hedged carry trades</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carry trades will likely be attractive in 1H24 given a Fed on hold, but we recommend hedging Fed easing expectations via Fronts Reds fkattenei’s to improve the carry-to-risk characteristics of these trades</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We look for lower implied volatility in 2024 with shorter expiries leading the decline. The volatility surface appears likely to normalize in coming months, as the upper left continues to decline on the back of stable policy rate expectations</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Curve volatility is likely poised to rise in 2024 as easing approaches, but YCSO implied volatility has recently tended to be rich. We develop a “synthetic” strategy, based on trading a triad of swaptions to create exposure to curve volatility, that is currently attractive as an alternate way to create long exposure to 2s/10s curve volatility</span></p></li></ul>
