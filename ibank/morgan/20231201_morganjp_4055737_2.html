Underlying this rise in risk appetite, the rates market now incoiporates relatively high probabilities of easing by both the Fed and ECB next quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A quick reversal after a substantial tightening has been the US business cycle norm: Fed easing started within a year of each tightening cycle since the 19 70s, except for 2004-06. It is notable, however, that these shifts to ease were all associated with a growth threat. There is no precedent for the disinflationary calibration of stances currently fueling soft-landing optimism. The current expansion has, of course, produced several unprecedented dynamics that we have highlighted as a reflection of cyclical “weirdo-nomics.” In this regard, we have raised our probability for a soft-landing outcome to 40% in recent months, recognizing better prospects for lowering inflation while sustaining private sector health. Howevei; absent a tangible threat to expansions, we see two factors slowing any move toward central bank easing next year</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation trends will take time to discern. We believe that major central banks will consider calibrating their restrictive stances once they are convinced that inflation will remain below 3% on a sustained basis. Howevei; this assessment will require an alignment of a broad set of conditions related to inertial prices, wages, and estimated slack. The significant bunching in wages and price adjustments that take place at the start of each year will promote patience to see whether the recent constrictive inflation news extends through 1Q24.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font3">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retlexivity. Ce ntra 1 b ankers a re ba nki ng on sustai ned demand restraint from their restrictive stances, a point Chair Powell referenced in this week’s speech. As a result, the current easing in financial conditions associated with greater soft-landing optimism will feed back to central bankers in the foim of promoting caution.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">The case for easing in early 2024 is still modest and more likely under scenarios in which growth weakens more than we anticipate. With the Euro area having stalled this year, and yet to show clear-cut signs of upward momentum, we link its downside growth risk to a greater chance of a move toward an early monetary ease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hints of improvement in industry</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">For over a year, global manufacturing has effectively stalled alongside only a modest gain in final demand and a drawingdown in the pace of inventory accumulation. Output looked to be perking up around midyear but this recovery was narrowly</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">based in the Asian tech sector. Gains have been softer and similarly mixed in September and October, and global manufacturing growth looks to have once again slowed to a stall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While the global PMI has not tracked the pace of growth in factory output well in recent years, it has provided a reasonable guide to momentum swings. This is important given that growth in global factory output has been both noisy and uneven. The global output PMI for November came in at 49.9 (Figure 3). While this is still only consistent with 0.3%ar growth in global manufacturing, the Ipt rise more than reverses the October drop, tempering the concern that activity was sliding into contraction. Importantly, the November gain in Europe, a region where the outlook has been particularly weak—and where the surveys tend to be the most accurate— is encouraging. As a bellwether for global industry, Asia also saw a notable rise in output PMIs, driven by Mainland China, Korea, and Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The improvement in Asia is echoed in the trade data but still appears somewhat tentative. Exports out of EM Asia rose 6.3%3m/3m, saar in October, while the tone from the for-ward-looking new export orders PMI dipped in November and suggests some moderation. More generally, the manufacturing recovery in Asia remains narrowly driven by tech, led by Korea and Taiwan but with Japan recently joining. Still-sluggish non-techproduction, combined with limited capex growth across the region, points to cautious corporate sentiment. For the tide to turn backup, better news on final demand growth will be needed. In this regard, the sizable bounce in the global investment goods PMI is encouraging, as it suggests a modest pickup in global capex growth after stalling for much of 2H23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">China policy boost given fragile momentum</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While recent policy easing in China has increased confidence in our outlook for solid growth during 1H24, incoming data— including October activity and November PMIs—suggest that the momentum of China’s recovery remains somewhat fragile</span></p>
