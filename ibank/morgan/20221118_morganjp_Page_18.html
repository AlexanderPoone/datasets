<p><span class="font5">Despite a $0.30 rise in leveraged loan prices during October, it was also a second consecutive month encompassing heightened rating and sector dispersion. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As such, the distressed universe of loans trading sub-$80 has risen by 120% the past two months. As well, the sub-$60 and sub-$70 universe of loans are at a high since October and May 2020, respectively. In particular, the amount of loans trading at or below $80 increased by +$27.2bn m/m to $127.2bn or 8.5% of outstanding. </span><span class="font5">For context, the amount of sub-$80 loans stood at $35bn at year-end 2020, $323bn in March 2020 and $67bn in February 2020. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides September’s $47bn m/m increase, October was the second largest increase in the distressed universe since the pandemic. And aside from the stretch between March and July 2020, the distressed universe of loans at 8.5% outstanding is now at a high since March 2016. Historically, in the 25 historical examples where the distressed universe accounted for 8-10% of outstanding, the average and median default rate 12M forward was only 2.5% and 1.5%, respectively. </span><span class="font5">During the GFC the % of the loan market that traded below $80 peaked at 81% (Dec-08) and during the 2000-02 recession the % peaked at 17.4% (Oct-02). Note an average 8.8 5% of the leveraged loan market traded below $80 over the three-year stretch ending 2012, a stretch coinciding with default rates consistently below 1.5%. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the $129.7bn of leveraged loans classified as distressed 22% is Technology, 21% is Healthcare, and 11% is Services. Meanwhile, the universe of loans trading sub-$60 and sub-$70 increased $1.8bn and $17.6bn to $26.9bn (or 1.8%) and $61.1bn (or 4.0%), respectively. </span><span class="font5">The largest contributors to the sub-$70 loan universe are Envision Healthcare, Diamond Sports Group, Asurion, Rackspace, and LogMein. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Note there are now $326bn of loans or 21.4% that trade $90 or below (+$7bn m/m). </span><span class="font5">This is a high for the sub-$90 universe since June 2020. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Meanwhile, the distressed universe of bonds/loans totaling $248bn (+$14bn m/m, +$194bn YTD) equates to 8.6% of leveraged credit and compares to $549bn or 29.1% in Mar-20 and $214bn or 8.9% in Feb-20. </span><span class="font5">This represents bonds trading 1000bp+ and loans below $80, and historically about one-third of this 8.6% universe default over the next 12 months.</span></p>
