<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">COSCO Pacific started out as a container leasing company under the COSCO Group (originally named Florens Group Limited) and first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in December 19,1994. </span><span class="font3">The company made its first container terminal acquisition, a 50% stake in COSCO-HIT Terminals in Hong Kong, in 1995 and the company was renamed COSCO Pacific the following year. Throughout the 1990s, CP continued to expand its container terminal operations, primarily through acquiring port assets from the parent, which allowed the company to establish itself as the flagship container terminal and leasing platform under the COSCO Group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the early 2000s, CP ventured overseas and made its first international port investment in 2003 via a 49% stake in COSCO-PSA in Singapore. </span><span class="font3">In the following years, CP started disposing of non-core businesses including a 20% stake in Chong Hing Bank in 2007, a 49% interest in COSCO Logistics in 2009, and a 21.8% interest in CIMC in 2013. Throughout this period of time, CP continued to expand it port network coverage while narrowing down its business focus to two core segments: container terminal operations and container leasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In August 2015, it was reported that China Shipping and COSCO group w ere in merger talks resulting in the shares of CP being suspended for several months. </span><span class="font3">Ultimately, it was announced that the port operations under the two groups would be consolidated under the CP platform while CP would dispose of its container leasing business as part of an asset reshuffling exercise between the two parent groups. This transaction was completed in March 2016 and CP is now a pure port operator. To reflect its new business structure, the company was renamed COSCO Shipping Ports Limited in July 2016.</span></p>
