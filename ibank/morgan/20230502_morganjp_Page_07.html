<p><span class="font2">The inevitable adjustment of macro imbalances</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Economics and FICC strategy team published </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Tiirkiye: Market implications of May 14 elections</span><span class="font4"> </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font4">. Below is the Executive Summary and two figures showing the post-election path for TRY and bond yields based on their two scenarios:</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Macroeconomic Outlook: The inevitable adjustment of macro imbalances</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Tiirkiye is </span><span class="font4">heading into </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">its </span><span class="font4">presidential and parliamentary elections on 14 May </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">facing </span><span class="font4">substantial macroeconomic challenges. Tiirkiye’s GDP grew 5.6%oya in 2022, above its potential growth, as a result of expansionary economic policies. Despite the favorable base effects, over-year-ago CPI inflation remained elevated at 50.5% in March 2023. We expect inflation to end the year at 45.7%, with the risks to the upside due to the expected lira depreciation and tax hikes in 2H23. The current account deficit widened to 5.4% of GDP in 2022 from 0.9% of GDP in 2021, and is set to widen further in 1H23 on the back of strong domestic demand coupled with energy and gold imports. Growth accelerated in 1Q23 on the back of fiscal and credit stimulus that could extend into 2Q23. This resulted in a wider current account deficit, putting pressure on the lira. The 12-month rolling current account deficit reached $55.4bn on February 2023, 6% of GDP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe that a macro adjustment is inevitable regardless of the result of elections. We expect 2H23 to mark the start of a correction of accumulated imbalances, namely elevated inflation and a large current account deficit. Sustainable lowering of inflation and the current account deficit requires tighter monetary conditions and fiscal tightening. In a scenario of a committed return to orthodox inflation-targeting policies, we anticipate the CBRT to hike the policy rate to 30% in 3Q23, from the current level of 8.5%. That said, more tightening towards 40% cannot be ruled out in 2H23. In the case that rate hikes do not materialize purposefiilly in 3Q23, macro imbalances would grow and, eventually, much bigger rate hikes would be required later this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Fiscal </span><span class="font4">outlook is challenging in 2023. Tiirkiye’s government budget deficit was only 0.9% of GDP in 2022 thanks to high tax revenues driven by strong growth and inflation. Tiirkiye’s EU-defined government debt declined to 31.7% of GDP in 2022, down from 41.8% of GDP in 2021 (Figure 3Government debto GDP sharply declined in 2022). That said, 2023 looks challenging. First, the earthquake-related relief and reconstruction efforts will weigh on the fiscal outlook. Second, the early retirement scheme coupled with the pension salary and bonus payment hikes announced in 1Q23 imply more spending (Figure 4Government budget balance deteriorated in 1Q23). Third, the FX-protected lira deposit amount reached TRY 1.78bn (i.e. $92.4bn). The fiscal cost of the FX-protected lira deposit scheme was 0.6% of GDP in 2022, but, given increased participation following the removal of the cap on the deposit rates, the cost could be sharply higher in 2023. Overall, we expect the budget deficit to widen from 0.9% of GDP in 2022 to 4.5% of GDP in 2023, with the risks to the upside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Against </span><span class="font4">a challenging global backdrop, the macro imbalances in </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Tiirkiye </span><span class="font4">should push growth sharply lower in 2023. We forecast 2.5% GDP growth in 2023 after 5.6% in 2022 and 11.4% in 2021. On the back of a sharp slowdown in domestic demand, strong tourism revenues, and the decline in the energy bill in 2H23, we expect a current account deficit of 3% of GDP in 2023, down from 5.4% of GDP in 2022.</span></p>
