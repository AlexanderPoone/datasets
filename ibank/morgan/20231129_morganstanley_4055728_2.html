<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">participants widely regarded as on the hawkish end of the spectrum not only seemingly shut the door on further rate hikes but also broached conditions and timing of rate cuts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Although USTs had begun to grind richer early in the NY morning, the pace of bullish price action picked up alongside remarks by Fed Governor Waller. In a speech titled &quot;Something Appears to Be Giving,&quot; Waller provided an update to his speech from October titled &quot;Something's Got to Give,&quot; where strong economic growth and employment data had occurred simultaneously with a moderation in core PCE inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Waller noted the &quot;data for October indicated an easing in economic activity, and forecasts for the fourth quarter show the kind of moderation that is more in keeping with progress on lowering inflation.&quot; This leaves him &quot;increasingly confident&quot; monetary policy is currently well positioned to slow the economy and get inflation back to 2%. Waller cited the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow model forecast of 2.10% q/q as a signal growth will moderate in the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As it relates to progress on inflation, characterized as &quot;encouraging,&quot; Waller emphasized the 3-month annualized core CPI at 3.4% in October, given it provides a &quot;better sense of the recent trend.&quot; Whether inflation will make continued progress toward 2% is key for the Fed reaction function, and Waller highlighted a crucial factor in favor of this outcome - the lagged effect of a moderation in rental prices over the past year should keep housing services inflation at a moderate Level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Waller also touched on monetary policy implications of the easing in financial conditions during November. He opted to look at a Longer trend and pointed out Long-term rates are still higher than before the middle of the year and financial conditions are still tighter. Alluding to the circular reference between financial conditions and monetary policy, he cautioned, &quot;the recent Loosening of financial conditions is a reminder that many factors can affect these conditions and that policymakers must be careful about relying on such tightening to do our job.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the moderated Q&amp;A portion, Waller discussed prospects for rate cuts and stated, &quot;if inflation goes down, you would Lower the policy rate.&quot; He provided additional context and said if Lower inflation continues for several more months &quot;I don't know how Long that might be—3 months? 4 months? 5 months?—you could then start lowering the policy rate because inflation's Lower.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Shortly afterwards, prepared remarks from a speech by Fed Governor Bowman were published. These contained an important shift as Bowman concluded she remains &quot;willing to support raising the federal funds rate at a future meeting should the incoming data indicate that progress on inflation has stalled or is insufficient to bring inflation down to 2 percent in a timely way.&quot;This seemingly conveyed rate hikes are no Longer her baseline and are now conditional on lack of progress on inflation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Front-end US Treasury yields fell sharply with the softer tone to Fedspeak, but in particular alongside Waller's discussion on conditions and timing of rate cuts. On the FOMC strip, this translated to a notable bull-flattening of reds/greens as forward pricing of Fed policy rates posted double-digit declines from June 2024. The</span></p>
