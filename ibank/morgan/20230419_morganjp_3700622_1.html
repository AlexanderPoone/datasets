<p><span class="font6">We think the 1Q23 real estate data from NBS may not yet drive up investors’ expectations. Residential sales value in March continued to see positive growth on both a Y/Y basis (+11%) and a 4-year average basis (+3%), but the trend is similar to that of </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">top 100 developers’ sales</span><span class="font6"> published earlier (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">fig. 3</span><span class="font6">). New starts were still disappointing with the Y/Y decline widening to 27% (2M23: -9%), while completions remained the outperformer with a +32% Y/Y growth (2M23: +8%). Among the three major metrics, we believe completions will see the strongest growth, followed by sales and lastly new starts. For </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">60-city weekly </span><span class="font6">sales, while there was still a positive Y/Y growth (+29%), we think this is not meaningfill as the base is low' (due to lockdowms last year). If compared to the 4-year average, the decline w'ould be 32%, which is slightly w'orse than the wreek before (-28%). Last wreek, the sector mildly rose 1% (driven by SOEs only), in line with HSCEI (+1%). In the near term, as wre do not expect a meaningful pickup in sales (on a 4-year average basis) or strong easing (as sales/home price are also not substantially deteriorating), wre reiterate our view' that the sector may stay range-bound in 2Q23. Top picks: </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COLI / CR Land / Poly PS / COPH / CR Mixc. </span><span class="font6">For pair trade, wre continue to recommend </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">long COLI &amp;&nbsp;short Vanke-H </span><span class="font6">(</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font6">) on grow'th differential (month-to-date: COLI +13% vs. Vanke-H +5%).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rare restatement in some data: </span><span class="font6">From the Y/Y grow th stated in 1Q23 data, wre deduced a restatement of 1Q22 data in sales value, sale volume &amp;&nbsp;real estate investment (REI). This does not typically happen, but the discrepancy is not too big either (e.g. residential sales value in March w'ould have been up 9% Y/Y, instead of 11% Y/Y; real estate investment in March w'ould have been down 7% Y/Y, instead of 6% Y/Y). While the reasons are not officially given, wre think this might be due to reclassification of certain sales transactions last year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales may soften in April on a 4-year average basis: </span><span class="font6">After an 11% Y/Y grow'th in March, wre think it may further expand in April but solely because of an even lowrer base. We think a fair comparison w'ould be to compare w'ith the 4-year average, and on that basis, sales may turn wreaker in April as seen in the weakening of the 60-city weekly sales explained below'.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New' starts may see some sequential improvement: </span><span class="font6">New' starts saw' </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font6">29% Y/Y decline in March, or down 41% if compared to the 4-year average. This is even w'orse than 2M23 (-9% Y/Y or -11% compared to the 4-year average). The wreak new' starts also dragged REI to stay wreak (-6% Y/Y, or down 2% compared to the 4-year average, w'hich is w'orse than the +8% in 2M23). Howrever, as land sales improved in 4Q22, and with a low' base effect, wre think new' starts wall improve in 2Q23. That said, even if new' starts revert to positive Y/Y grow'th, on a 4-year average basis wre think it w'ill still be negative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Momentum in completions remained solid: </span><span class="font6">Completions rose 32% </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Y/Y </span><span class="font6">in March (or +12% if compared to the 4-year average), showing government’s push for more construction resumptions is wrorking. This is tracking wrell to achieve our full-year forecast of a 4% Y/Y increase.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60-city weekly sales </span><span class="font6">(</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">more)</span><span class="font6">: Sales mildly grew' 8% WAV, with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Y/Y </span><span class="font6">grow'th narrowing to 29%. However, if compared to the 4-year average, Sales wrere -32%, widening from -28% in the wreek before. This is not a surprise to us as developers have been flagging the physical market has cooled dowm since March. While wre expect a positive Y/Y grow'th in April &amp;&nbsp;May (due to a low' base), on a 4-year average basis wre think it may stay lackluster (dowm 20-30%).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Policy update </span><span class="font6">(</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">full summary</span><span class="font6">): Local-level easing w'as minimal last wreek, with some mild HPF easing in Quanzhou &amp;&nbsp;Shao guan.</span></p></li></ul>
