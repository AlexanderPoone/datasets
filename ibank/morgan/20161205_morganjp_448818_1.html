<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Bid for Duet opens doors to more acquisitions; likely no special DPS from PAH</span></h5>
<p><span class="font5">Cheung Kong Infrastructure's A$7.3B bid for Duet Group is inline with its strategy to acquire regulated utilities and infrastructure assets in developed markets with stable cash yield. Given the size of this acquisition, we believe Power Assets (PAH) is also potentially involved in this deal. While the headline price looks expensive vs recent comps (see below), we expect potential 2018E EPS upside of 5% for CK1 and 8% for PAH if they each took a 40% stake in the asset. CKI/PAH may be studying other acquisitions like this, in our view, and PAH may not pay a special DPS next year if there are still many M&amp;A opportunities ahead.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Details of the offer. </span><span class="font5">Duet Group (DUE AU) said in a statement that CKI has submitted an indicative and nonbinding offer to acquire 100% of the company for A$3/stapled security, or A$7.3B in total. The conditional offer is subject to completion of satisfactory due diligence, among others. We believe the biggest hurdle would be approval from Foreign Investment Review Board. The Australian federal treasurer had blocked CKI and Power Assets’s bid for Ausgrid in Aug 2016. CKI has not commented on the deal.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied valuation at high end. </span><span class="font5">The offer price implies an enterprise value/ regulated asset base (EV/RAB) of 1.68x, according to J.P. Morgan Energy and Utilities Team (see note </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">here)</span><span class="font5">. This is higher than the 1.4x valuation paid for Ausgrid and is higher than Duet's historic trading range of 1.1 -1.6x.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arc they overpaying? We </span><span class="font5">believe CKI and Power Assets are attracted to the cash yield of the asset, which provides for an implied dividend yield of 6.3% based on the offer price. The pair’s typical required cash yield on investments is c8%. This investment could help them achieve that considering the potential synergies of the assets and potential lowering of finance costs, taxes and labor costs after the acquisition.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Synergies from regulated assets. </span><span class="font5">Duet Group’s key assets are: 1) United Energy, power distributor in Victoria, 2) Multinet Gas, gas distributor in Victoria, and 3) Dampier-Bunbury pipeline, gas transmission pipeline in Western Australia. These projects complement CKI’s and Power Assets’s gas and power grid exposure in Australia, with their ownership in SA Power Networks, Victoria Power Networks and Australian Gas Networks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential 5-8% upside to EPS. </span><span class="font5">Based on their previous track record, we believe CKI and Power Asset will each take a c40% stake in the project, with the remaining interest going to another CK group entity. This would result in a potential 5% EPS upside for CKI in 2018 and 8% for PAH, on our estimates. After this transaction, CKI would not have much room on its balance sheet left for additional acquisitions as the group level net gearing would rise to 15%, on our estimates. (See table below)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional M&amp;A targets. </span><span class="font5">CKI is reportedly bidding for UK’s smart meter company, Calvin Capital, and Spain’s gas distribution networks, Redexis. (Source: Bloomberg).</span></p></li></ul>
