<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Time to add some long USD exposure: </span><span class="font5">As volatility in global bank stocks picked up in March, we removed any remaining bullish EM exposure. At the time, we felt that it was a prudent decision given the high uncertainty over the outlook for the financial sector in the US and Europe.
