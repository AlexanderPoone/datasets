<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark1"></a>We reiterate our view that 2024 will be another strong year for China's key WFE players</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">We have published our positive outlook for 2024 (see our report - November 5, 2023). Moreover, key foundry projects Hua Hong (report) and SMIC (report) raised their 2023 and 2024 capex during their 3Q23 analyst meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">YMTC's 30-40 kwpm investment (or US$3.0bn) in 2024 leads to more upside</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">YMTC has not been expanding capacity in the past year, owing to export control, and we Learned from supply chain checks that the key bottleneck has been Lam Research's etching equipment. Our industry checks suggest that YMTC will start to adopt Local etching equipment (60-70% from AMEC, 30-40% from Naura and others) and thus that YMTCshould be able to expand capacity 30-40kwpm in 2024 (Exhibit 2). We believe the production yield rate from adopting Local Chinese etching equipment may be Lower than that of Lam Research's equipment, but this would still be an important breakthrough if YMTC can start to expand capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">YMTC's expansion fuels substantial upside for AMEC (OW) and for Naura (OW) - (revenue contributions of &gt;35% and 5%)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe YMTC will become one of AMEC's Largest clients in 2024 (&gt;35% of revenue, by our estimate), according to our scenario analysis. From our industry checks, we Learned that AMEC should start to ship to YTMC in 1H24. AMEC said that it is working hard on having 0% exposure to US components for its equipment production - the company will replace all US components before the end of 2023 by using Chinese Local suppliers, as well as components from Japan, Germany, etc).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">AMEC guided for 2024 revenue to be more than Rmb8.0bn. GM could be 1-2ppt Y/Y Lower than 2023 as the majority of equipment shipments are for Larger customers this year (vs. 2O23's being mainly to Tier 2/Tier 3 customers). The company expects net margin to reach 20-25%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">AMEC is also working on its reduced pressure EPI tools (currently advanced node capacity bottleneck is Applied Material RP EPI tools). It aims to Look for qualification with key customers in 1Q24.</span></p>
