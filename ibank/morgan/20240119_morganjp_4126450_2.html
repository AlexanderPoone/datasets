<p><span class="font4">Recent signs of life in global goods demand is a bright spot. Global consumer goods spending growth has perked back up to a solid 2.4%ar in the three months through November, and this week’s US retail sales report for December was strong. Our global capex nowcaster has also picked up in recent months. However, any sustained pickup in global goods demand will likely require better news from Western Europe, where a cautious consumer has been a sustained growth drag. A sharp slide in European inflation provides the fuel for lift as real labor income is now accelerating at a faster than 2%ar. But the clock is ticking. The loss of pricing power for businesses will, absent a pickup in domestic spending, eventually motivate a pullback in hiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">After two years of 5%ar gains, global core inflation tumbled to a 3.3%ar in 2H23. While optimism is increasing that the “last mile” of disinflation will soon follow, there are reasons to be cautious. Most of last year’s disinflation came in goods but commodity prices are no longer falling and traded goods prices point to a moderating deflationary impulse from China (Figure 2). The recent disruptions in Red Sea trade could add as much as 0.7%-pt to annualized global core goods inflation in 1H24. Positive inflation outcomes look likely to require material core service disinflation. But absent a material easing in labor markets or weak service sector demand, fundamental supports for this slide will not be in place. On balance, we maintain global core inflation of 3%ar in 1H24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Against this backdrop, central bankers have become more optimistic that they can calibrate policy stances that are perceived to be materially restrictive. However, this optimism is cautious and the nearly unanimous message from a large number of DM central banks in recent weeks, including the Fed and ECB, is that rate cuts are unlikely to start this quarter (Figure 3). The realization of our forecast for growth resilience and sticky core inflation aligns with a more gradual midyear start to DM easing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Ever since Chair Powell’s dovish press conference in December, Fed rhetoric has attempted to temper market enthusiasm for March cuts—including comments this week from the more dovish Atlanta Fed president Bostic that he expected the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">first cut not to come until 3Q24. In the Euro area, a weak growth backdrop and sharper drop in inflation warrant an earlier ease. Even still, President Lagarde indicated a “summer” start to rate cuts and pushed back forcefully against market expectations for as much as 150bp of cuts this year. Recognizing that incoming reports have shifted the balance of risks, we have pulled forward the start of ECB rate cuts to June, in line with our forecast for the Fed. We also now look for BoE easing to start in August. Next week we expect Norges Bank to remain on hold following its surprise hike in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">BoJ to tighten guidance, not tools</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Being the only central bank to have yet raised its policy rate from the emergency lows of the pandemic, the BoJ is charting its own course and remains focused on assuring the rise in inflation over the past two years is sustainable. Despite the weak headline figures in Japan’s latest CPI inflation (December) and wage growth (November) reports, the underlying details point to ongoing firming of inflation dynamics. We think the recent data, alongside firms’ indications to raise wages, are helping to gradually bolster the BoJ’s confidence that such structural changes are indeed taking place—a neces-saiy condition to start normalizing policy. Tliat, in turn, should be enough for the BoJ to change the tone of its policy statement next week, removing the strong easing bias from its forward guidance and potentially introducing more flexibility into its JGB purchases. But greater confidence will be needed to remove its negative interest rate policy, which we continue to expect to be a mid-year event.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">BoC still battling sticky core inflation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The Bank of Canada is expected to remain on hold next week and, as with most other DM central banks, recent comments have pushed back against an early policy pivot. Indeed, stubbornly elevated BoC core inflation measures—stuck in a 3% to 4% range for the past year—are challenging a return to the 2% target. The latest 4Q Business Outlook Survey suggests a gradual normalization of expected inflation, wage growth, and corporate pricing behavior. The BoC is in no huriy to ease, and it is hard to see a softening of the currently hawkish forward guidance next week. This contrast in inflation outlooks has led markets to shift toward lower odds of the BoC easing than the Fed during 1H24 and a shallower BoC cutting cycle this year. We still expect the first BoC cut in 2Q23, as signs of an expected downward trend in inflation and wage growth, along with weaker demand, should become apparent by then.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Imbalances a later risk to China growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">China’s 4Q23 GDP growth came in broadly as expected at 5.8%q/q, saar, resulting in full-year growth (5.2%y/y) modestly above the official target of “around 5%.” But the latest</span></p>
