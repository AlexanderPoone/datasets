<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Weichai Power - H </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Overweight; Price Target: HK$15.00)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">YTD Weichai’s share has rebounded strongly, reversing last year’s underperformance as industry sales recovered while Weichai regained lost market share. In 2015, it saw core net profit drop c60% Y/Y in part because Beiqi Foton aggressively cut its Weichai orders. Beiqi’s sourcing ratio from Weichai slid to c25-30% in 2015 from 60-70%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Looking ahead, we believe the company’s earnings quality and growth outlook are improving on the back of: (1) we think Foton will raise its Weichai procurement ratio in 2016 in order to protect its market share, while giving its JV brand more time to establish itself; (2) recent datapoints that suggest that industiy demand may have bottomed; (3) KION contributions becoming more visible in 2015 and continuing to be a more significant source of earnings for Weichai going forward; and (4) the hydraulic component segment, which could be a potential source of upside as Weichai aims to capture one-third of the midrange to high-end hydraulic components segment by 2020, while segment margins are also expected to rise toward the estimated steady-state level of 30-40% (&lt;30% last year).</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our Dec-17 PT of HK$15.0 is based on our DCF valuation. Key assumptions in our DCF valuation include a WACC of 10%, driven by a cost of equity of 10.7%, a cost of debt of 5.0%, a target debt-to-capital of 10% and terminal growth of 0%. Our PT translates into a target FY16E P/E of 24.3x, EV/EBITDA of 6.5x and P/BV of 1.6x.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Downside risks to our rating and PT include: (1) a weaker-than-expected recovery in heavy-duty truck sales and construction machineiy sales; (2) worse-than-expected synergy from the Linde acquisition; and (3) successful vertical integration by end customers.</span></p>
