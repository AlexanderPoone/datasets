<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Stocks usually move ahead of fundamental troughs. </span><span class="font2">With companies aggressively guiding down earnings but stocks reacting positively to bad news for the most part, we feel that the debate on how bad the demand outlook could be is no longer useful - and is one of the reasons why we have upgraded many cyclical parts in tech (LCD, memory and MLCC) and remain confident on their outperformance in the next 12 months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Exhibit </span><span class="font3">1: 2019 vs. 2023 - cyclica I inflections a re initia lly driven by multiple re-rating, not ea rnings</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">When is a good entry point? </span><span class="font2">The current cycle has been punitive, in a historical context, in terms of magnitude and duration. Risks are discounted closer to a bear case scenario approaching 20 08 GFC extremes, whereas a similar economic hard-landing in 2023 is highly unlikely, in our view. In Exhibit 8, we illustrate some of the historical data with an overlay of share price and consensus earnings trajectory. Over the Long term there is a close correlation between share price and earnings, however, at inflections, there is an offset with shares having historically risen well before earnings had bottomed, i.e, the shares begin to work well before the end of the downgrade cycle. Tech shares outperformed 4 months before an earnings trough in the 2008 cycle, 4 months before in 2012 and 8 months before in 2018. In Exhibit 9, we compare earnings revision breadth of different segments with previous trough levels; at the late stage of the down-cycle, we believe it is prudent to look for opportunities in sectors where both earnings and valuation downside appear exhausted.</span></p>
