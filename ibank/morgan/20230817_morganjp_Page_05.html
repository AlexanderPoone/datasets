<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Strategy: Net FX position makes an FX float less likely and halts Eurobond upward price momentum</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Nigeria’s exchange rate market remains fragmented (see </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">here)</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font6">Since the adjustment of USD/NGN at the Investors and Exporters window (now renamed Nigeria Foreign Exchange Market - NFEX) a few weeks ago, interbank FX liquidity has not improved as much as anticipated, partly due to the re-introduction of de-facto controls limiting local trades above 800 and loose monetary policy conditions. Also, the CBN continues to intervene in small amounts at a rate around 740-750, without clearing the backlog of unmet FX demand. Furthermore, the parallel market rate has widened to around 900 due to a combination of seasonal summer increase in FX demand and renewed loss of confidence in the local currency by locals. All this is further compounded by revelations that the central bank’s net foreign exchange reserves may be lower than initially thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Lower net FX reserves reduces the ability and willingness to introduce a flexible exchange rate regime in the near term. </span><span class="font6">Owing to a structural balance of payments deficit in Nigeria, and a worse starting point for net FX reserves than previously anticipated (see above), authorities’ ability to transition to a significantly more flexible exchange rate regime is severely hampered. The process of rebuilding reserve buffers is likely to be protracted as significant reforms are needed to attract foreign direct (and portfolio) investment on a multi-year basis. Perhaps short-term fixes could involve a swift improvement in oil output and significantly tighter monetary policy - authorities will have to increase the frequency of OMO auctions, which resumed last week. In the meantime, we remain on the sidelines, but on balance of risks we now believe selling USD/NGN NDFs may be the next trade given the reduced likelihood of further significant near-term FX adjustments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">A lower-than-anticipated net FX reserves position unnerved eurobond markets ending the period of positive reform momentum euphoria. </span><span class="font6">Bond prices declined 2.5-5pts across the curve since the CBN's financials release (Figure 3). The main point of contention behind this price action has been a lower than initially anticipated net FX reserves position where some clarity is still awaited. While gross reserves at $37bn is a positive, higher short-term liabilities do raise a concern in case of roll-over pressures and thus, an increased risk premium is warranted. The recent news around the potential re-introduction of the fuel subsidies at some level (see above) has also raised concerns. That said, already higher oil prices and a relatively flexible exchange rate than pre-May could eventually mean a relatively lower impact. Nonetheless, given the recent spate of concerning newsflow, sovereign bonds could remain under pressure. EMBIGD Nigeria STW has already seen some retracement of the sharp tightening that happened post the speedy reform execution by the new administration (Figure 4). That said, the announcement of a cabinet which appointed technocrats in key positions, such as the Ministry of Finance may slow the price decline in the near term. We are cautiously optimistic on reforms but acknowledge near-term FX-related pressure and remain MW Nigeria in the EMBIGD Model Portfolio.</span></p>
