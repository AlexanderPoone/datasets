<p><span class="font2">According to Fed data, non-financial CP outstandings declined slightly this year, down $ 12bn to $261 bn as of 9/27. As a percentage of the total USCP market, non-financial CP now accounts for 2 2% versus its local peak of 25% in June 2023 (Figure 1). Even so, non-financial CP outstandings are still well above the three-year average of $242bn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That said, a closer look at the composition of non-financial CP outstandings reveals differing behaviors among Tier 1 and Tier 2 issuers. In fact, the slight decline in non-financial CP outstandings YTD seems to be driven entirely by Tier 2 issuers, as their outstandings have declined by 20% or $24bn YTD (Figure 2). Their balances have now fallen to around $95bn from a local peak of $ 140bn in late Febmary, though they are still above the 10-year average of $85bn. Meanwhile, Tier 1 non-financial CP outstandings have increased by 8%, or $12bn, during the same period. It’s possible some Tier 2 issuers might have decided to term out their maturities given comparable yields between the Tier 2 CP market and l-3y HG market. As Figure 3 shows, the spread between Im Tier 2 CP yields and 1 -3y BBB were as tight as -59bp in March, a substantial narrowing from +200bp in last September, though they have since positively reverted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In any case, the decline in Tier 2 CP supply has likely contributed to spread tightening in Tier 2 CP, as liquidity investors continue to be flush with cash and are looking for yieldy products. Indeed, the spread between Tier 2 CP and 1-month T-bills has drastically narrowed over the past few months and is currently at 28bp as of 9/28, significantly below the YTD average (Figure 4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As year-end inches closer, bank CP/CD spreads tend to widen. This technical aspect of the market can have a ripple effect for non-financial issuers that tend to roll their existing maturities. In particular, Tier 2 issuers often have shorter CP WAMs, which may lead to these issuers having to issue at wider spreads when their existing maturities come due. Indeed, based on data from 2017-2022, we estimate that yields for Tier 2 non-financials tend to increase on average by 17-23bp in December for 1-3-month tenors (Figure 5). Even though Tier 2 supply has compressed this year, it’s likely spreads for Tier 2 issuerswill widen, especially entering December, though it’s possible the spread widening might be a little bit more muted if the demand for non-financial CP outweighs supply.</span></p>
