<p><span class="font1">uncertainty. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">EUR/USD </span><span class="font1">should be propelled higher by repatriation flows and elevated Local capital demand. USD/JPYcould go Lower, given the end of the policy divergence narrative in 2023. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">GBP </span><span class="font1">should be a key Laggard in G10 next year given its extremely weak growth outlook. Risk-sensitive European currencies gain, with EUR/NOK and EUR/SEK both falling to 9.60 and 10.30 by end-2023. EUR/CHF rises to 1.02, but the move is gradual given ongoing uncertainty and continued focus by the SNB on the currency. We see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">AUD/USD </span><span class="font1">at 0.70 as domestic growth outperforms; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">NZD/USD </span><span class="font1">rise even more as the RBNZ reaches an elevated terminal rate. A soft Landing in the US and rising oil prices weighs on USD/CAD, Lowering it to 129. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">FX-implied volatility </span><span class="font1">falls in 2023 as financial conditions peak, USD weakens, global bond yields move Lower, and global risk sentiment improves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Inflation-Linked Bonds</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the US, </span><span class="font1">we see real yields Leading the move Lower in nominal rates over the next year, with a small widening in breakevens. We maintain our Long 6m6m inflation recommendation. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Japan, </span><span class="font1">we discuss JGBi breakevens and the real yield outlook. We see breakevens grinding higher gradually, but the real yield going higher on the back of the BoJ's eventual YCC tweaking. We maintain LongJGBi 24 or 26 vs matched maturity swap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Short-Duration Strategy</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the US, </span><span class="font1">we see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">QT </span><span class="font1">ongoing throughout next year and into mid-2024 but caution that other obstacles such as a hard Landing could Lead to a premature end to QT. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RRP </span><span class="font1">should end next year at $12tr with the main catalysts beingl) higher MMF WAMs as the Fed pauses, 2) cheaper investment alternatives in the front end, and 3) higher repo rates. We see over $1tr in net </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">T-bill issuance </span><span class="font1">and total outstanding to reach $5tn by YE with the debt Limit presenting challenges along the way. We expect </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">SOFR andEFFR </span><span class="font1">to start moving higher within the target range, reading to wider SOFR-EFFR, particularly in 2H23. Finally, we see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">wholesale funding </span><span class="font1">demand to continue and for issuance in FHLB debt, CD, and CP to remain positive Leading to higher funding costs. We maintain our short 2y SOFR swap spread. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Japan, </span><span class="font1">we discuss the 2023 outlook for XCCY basis. Given our view of benign credit spreads and a weaker USD, we expect the SOFR/USD basis to tighten, Led by the short end, on the back of its attractive carry profile. We exit receiving 2s10s20s fly on SOFR/TONA basis, and enter pay W</span></p>
