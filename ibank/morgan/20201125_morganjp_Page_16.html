<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Prefer staples over retailers; valuations offer room to sustain the rally</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Increasing mobility combined with a recovery in Turkish tourism should spur interest in the Consumer Staples and Aviation sectors in 2021, while Food Retailers’ earnings momentum, which was inflated in 2020, will be challenged next year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Coca Cola Icecek and Anadolu Efes are likely to be the winners of an economy that is opening up, shifting consumption from stay-at-home to away-from-home, helping lucrative on-premise revenues to pick-up. On-premise impact is notable for both companies, particularly when looking at their Turkish operations that account for 20% revenues at Icecek and 25% at Efes. Opening this channel will drive revenue growth higher than average, which in return should support margins albeit with a normalization in marketing costs. Meanwhile, both companies presented top-class product execution during the pandemic and recorded outstanding margins which hit record high levels at Icecek and are showing positive signs of bottoming out in beer operations at Efes. We are confident that the majority of cost savings in 2020 are permanent, whereas the success of lean SKU management is encouraging, shaping the companies’ new growth strategies. Further, strong cash flow generation is a differentiating factor, providing an extra cushion against a potential increase in competition under normalized economies.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">As per value, Icecek and Efes offer attractive entry levels with a &gt;40% discount to global peers on EBITDA multiples. Investors have been downplaying the growth credentials at both companies in the past couple of years largely due to a volatile macro environment in Turkey and margin sensitivity to fit moves. With Turkey monetary policy now stepping into more predictable territory, there is solid ground for valuation disparity to change in favor of Turkish staples. Furthermore, both companies represent a turnaround story. Icecek continues to differentiate itself from global bottlers with its superior growth supported by the underpenetrated nature of its operating countries. It has room to expand product/price mix and hence improve profitability further. This together with a normalized capex cycle should improve its value creation credentials.
