<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assembly line has hit a snag. </span><span class="font7">Loan and CLO markets have been in a negative feedback loop. CLO investors look at price moves (and rating downgrades) in loans to set benchmarks, while loan participants look at distressed CLO liability pricing (and warehouses out of the money). It's nearly 20 business days with no new CL Os. At time of writing, CLO AAAs in secondary had started easing from a post crisis high -400bps to a range of 275-425bp (primary AAAs usually 120-150bp in 'normal' times). Secondary will need to normalize for origination to kickstart.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which has impacted ’’raw material”. </span><span class="font7">Leveraged loan prices are down nearly $19 since Feb 21 and spreads are now l,236bp, their highest levels since the financial crisis. March’s -17.49% total return for loans is easily the worst on record, surpassing Oct-2008’s -13.87%. The loan market is now pricing in a default rate of 18-30%, depending on recovery rate assumptions (50% or 70%, or somewhere in between). While it is probably too soon to say the market has reached its bottom, given the widespread sell off, pockets of value are certainly beginning to emerge</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part intellectual curiosity, part opportunity hunting. </span><span class="font7">Our fundamental analyst team has assembled a cohort of same obligor bond and loan relationships across sectors. Note bond issuing loan borrowers are now a minority in the loan market, and our cohort therefore skews to larger companies vs. the broader loan market. Additionally, for simplicity’s sake our analyst team avoided “obvious” default candidates. Nonetheless, the relative relationships are an interesting and useful commentary as investors broadly search for the best risk-adjusted opportunities in broadly dislocated credit markets.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mastery of the obvious. </span><span class="font7">Markets are truly dislocated when same obligor risk at the secured level trades close to or inside of unsecured obligor risk. While that appears to be a rarity from a yield standpoint, on a price standpoint that is extremely prevalent. Certainly both yield and price are ultimately critical to the final return calculus. However, the opportunity to create senior secured risk at substantial discounts to par and prices approximating unsecured risk represent a unique, likely temporary moment in time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considerations beyond structure. </span><span class="font7">Maintenance covenants are now a rarity (only 18% of the names in our cohort have maintenance covenants). But the actuality of potential “Zero revenue” months in the near-term means that covenants are likely to be tripped. That offers an opportunity for lenders to capture additional compensation in the form of consent fees or remarking coupons to market. Additionally, LIBOR floors are also far less prevalent than a few years ago; but given the direction of rates seem especially attractive.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guilty of burying the lede. </span><span class="font7">With the obvious caveat that both loan and security prices are exceptionally volatile currently, secured loans in our cohort trade $5.68pts cheap to pari passu secured bonds, and yield 119bp more. That discount certainly seems large; particularly given potential additional consent fees and prepayments at par. More interestingly, secured loans trade $0.91 below unsecured bonds (average loan price of $85.41), and yield just 58pp less. Given similar dollar prices, the upside total return potential is likely quite similar in loans vs. bonds. More importantly, structurally senior loans should have less downside potential than unsecured bonds. The relative aggregate upside/downside in loans, therefore, seems quite interesting. See below for our loan-bond cohorts, as well as the relevant industry fundamental credit analyst for additional name specific insights and thoughts.</span></p></li></ul>
