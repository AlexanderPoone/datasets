<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Apparent stall in reform momentum and lower net FX reserves than expected unnerve markets, but we remain cautiously optimistic. </span><span class="font9">Nigeria’s sovereign bond prices declined by 2.5-5pts across the curve since the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) published its audited financial accounts late last week. Also, the decision to freeze petrol prices at current levels resulted in concerns that fuel subsidies may have been reinstated, further weighing on asset prices. That said, the announcement of a cabinet which appointed technocrats in key positions, such as the Ministry of Finance may slow the eurobond price decline in the near term, even if a likely slower pace of reform implem entation could lim it bond upside from here. The foreign exchange market will remain in focus given the likely lower starting point for net FX reserves, with an overall balance of payments deficit pointing towards continued FX pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Reform fatigue or pause to reassess? </span><span class="font9">Nigeria's new administration had a blistering start in June, enacting key reform measures including the rem oval of fuel subsidies,followed by significant adjustments in the FX market. Since then, petrol prices have more than doubled and the naira has depreciated by c.40% against the dollar in the official market. However, in recent days the spread between the parallel market (900) and interbank exchange (770) rates have widened, while the president this week </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">announced</span><span class="font9"> there will be no further increase in petrol prices. While we think the FX m arket could benefit from better price discovery, we do not interpret the freeze on petrol prices as a reversal of the subsidy reform for now. This is because we estimate that at current average retail prices (NGN617/ltr), crude oil prices (US$85/barrel) and the parallel market exchange rate (900), authorities are not currently subsidising petrol (Table 1, </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">here)</span><span class="font9">. However, invariably, a further rise in these key variables and governm ent’s insistence on keeping petrol prices flat will result in a return of subsidies.</span></p>
