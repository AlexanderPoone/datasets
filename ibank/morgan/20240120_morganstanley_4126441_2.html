<p><span class="font4">Groundhog Day for Data? Not So Fast, Punxsutawney Phil</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To some, 2024 has started in the same vein as 2023. Better data to start the year sends bond yields and equity prices higher. Hawkish Fed speak (Waller) pushes back on market-implied rate cuts. And it all happens in the context of Groundhog Day occurring at the beginning of every year (on February 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">However, a more precise accounting of the start of 2024 shows important differences from the start of 2023. In particular, the weather in the US. The data we received for December 2023 in January 2024 generally beat expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That data, in combination with slightly more hawkish Fedspeak and the upcoming US Treasury refunding, sent yields higher from Local lows. This is &quot;the dip&quot; we have been Looking to buy. Does weather play a factor in our decision to buy bonds on this dip? Yes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We think that an unusually warm December 2023 probably helped the US economy. It certainly stands to reason that when the weather is nice, activity picks up relative to when weather is not so nice. In Exhibit 1, we show &quot;heating degree days&quot; in the US in December. The Low reading in 2023 suggests the weather was warmer than average, and much warmer than December 2022.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. A 'degree day' is a unit of measure for recording how hot or how cold it hasbeen over a 24-hour period. The number of degree days is determined by calculating the mean temperature fa the day and then com paring the mean temperature to a base value of 65 degrees E The 'mean' tern per at ure is calculated by adding together the high for the day and the low fa the day, and then dividing the result by 2. If the mean temperature for the day is, say, 5 degrees lower than 65, then there have been 5 heating degree days.</span></p>
