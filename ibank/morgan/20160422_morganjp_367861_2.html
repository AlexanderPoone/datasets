<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Automation to cut labor cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TTI is just in the early stages of using automation to improve labour productivity. Most of the advances so far have been to use better equipment to increase the speed of workers during the assembly process. However, the use of automation and robots to lower labor requirements in material handling and logistics has just begun. We have seen only a small part of the factory using automated robots taking components to the production lines without humans involved. For most of the factory floor, the delivery of components is still using push carts. Since 2008 sales have increased more than 60% (to 2016E sales) but the number of total workers at TTI has fallen by about 20% over the same period almost doubling sales per employee for TTI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Two key battery suppliers now</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">TTI has narrowed its suppler of lithium ion battery cells to two Korean suppliers now (Samsung and LG) and has cut the Japanese and Chinese suppliers over the past 2 years. TTI buys the cells and packages the cells with proprietary in-house electronics in order to make the entire battery component customized for power tools and floor care (in management's opinion superior to other manufacturers who do not customize battery units).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our PT of HK$43.0 implies a forward P/E of 19x (CY17E). The key risks are raising costs of production in China and a slow er-than-ex pec ted recovery in US demand</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please see our latest update </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">^</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Techtronic Industries: Lowering PT to $43 - Tools' continue to shine and we expect a floor care recovery</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font4"> dated 16 March 2016 for more details</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We believe TTI should benefit from the normalization of demand for power tools and floor care products in the U.S. TTI has been gaining market share in the US during a slump in demand, and is well positioned to benefit in a recovery, in our view. TH has 15% of its sales to Euro-denominated markets and is now benefiting from a recovery in demand in Europe, as well as the rise in the Euro in recent montlis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Dec-16 price target is based on our DCF valuation that assumes a market risk premium of 6.0% and a risk-free rate of 4.2% (yield on 10-year government notes in China). We have assumed a beta of 1.0. This is more conservative than the 0.7 Bloomberg beta. Accordingly, we assume a WACC of 9%. We estimate free cash flow until 2020 and assume a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. The terminal growth is based on the annual growth rate expected in 2020 (the final year of the estimate period) subject to a minimum of 1.5% and a maximum of 4.5%, depending on the nature of the industry and the level of maturity in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The key risks to our PT arc a rising cost of production in China and a slowcr-than-expected recovery in US demand. Another risk is the implementation of new product launches and whether or not they arc accepted by customers.</span></p>
