<p><span class="font4">pect the BCRP to hike the policy rate again by 50bp this week to 4.5%. Different from the recently more dovish tilt of regional peers, we believe the BCRP will be mindful of the potential costs associated to policy errors at this juncture, of particular relevance for financially dollarized economies. Meanwhile, on the political front, President Castillo survived a new recall attempt last week with the opposition failing to gather the necessary two-thirds supermajority. Yet, we believe political risk will linger, with the Congress coming again against the president either via a Constitutional accusation (longer process but only requires 66 votes) or another recall attempt in 2H22. Amid political, institutional, and global uncertainty, we flag that the risk is for a higher rather than a lower policy rate. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(D. Pereira /L.

<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Ecuador: Lasso recalculates the strategy ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Following the rejection of the Investment bill, uncertainty increased around whether the president would be willing to invoke Article 148 of the Constitution to dismiss the Assembly and call for anticipated legislative and presidential elections (i.e., known as “Muerte Cruzada”). Yet last week developments revealed that the government has discarded such a strategy for now, potentially with the idea that it could lead to a more destabilizing scenario for the country. Indeed, the chief of staff together with other government advisors who supported the “Muerte Cruzada” call resigned from their positions claiming disagreement on the path chosen by the government. The government thus seems to have reassessed its strategy, seeking to first revive its image and then potentially to call for a referendum down the road (likely next year) to put into consideration some of the reforms in the pipeline. In the meantime, Lasso claimed that he will govern “as if the National Assembly does not exist,” thus raising further tensions with opposition lawmakers amid cross-fire corruption allegations. Still, the available tools (i.e., executive decree, regulations) suggest limited margin of maneuver for now; rather, the government will focus on trade agreements and investments agenda. In all, despite the political noise, fundamental drivers for Ecuador are supportive in our view, with the higher oil price windfall helping to consolidate fiscal accounts, and with the ongoing expected support of the IMF (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">note)</span><span class="font4">. We now watch for the fourth (delayed) IMF revision to conclude to reassess the risks around our base case scenario if need be. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(L.

<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Costa Rica: President-elect Chaves to face split Assembly</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Yesterday, centrist PPSD candidate Rodrigo Chaves won the presidential runoff election with nearly 53% of the votes, beating former President José Maria Figueres from PLN, who couldn’t catch up with Chaves in spite of a close race that showed a technical tie last week. The electoral turnout was one of the lowest in the last 80 years and now, Chaves will have to work with a divided congress, where his party holds 17.5% of the seats versus 33% that is controlled by the PLN. President-elect Chaves pledged to overhaul the political system through referendums, which is not surprising given the divided congress that could delay important structural reforms, as well as recent Latin American precedent. Still, Chaves is expected to stick with the macroeconomic strategy outlined with the IMF since early 2021, when an agreement was reached to support the economy with an Extended Fund Facility. Last month, the IMF gave the green light to the second tranche of the EFF program. Official results will be released later this week, and President Chaves will swear in on May 8 for a four-year period. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(G. Lozano)</span></p>
