<p><span class="font4">Asia EM Equity Strategy I Asia Pacific</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Early year trends - Japan is outperforming</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Japan has continued its bull run at the start of 2024, while EM and China are lagging meaningfully. At the stock level in EM, outperformers are clustered in India and Saudi Arabia whilst within the Japan market, Industrials have been outperforming IT early on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Key Takeaways</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to prefer Japan &amp;&nbsp;India versus overall EM and China this year and reiterate our theme of a New Era in Asia /EM equities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">■ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is somewhat of a positive correlation historically for Japan equities between early year positive performance and full year performance.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Japan has made a strong start to 2024 with TOPIX gaining +5.3% YTD (in JPY terms or +0.2% in US$) as of 18th January. Strong nominal GDP growth and positive earnings revisions as well as a structural trend to rising ROE have been driving the outperformance versus RoW - see our recent major note on Japan - Japan Secular Bull Market Arrives: Here is How to Play It. Japan remains a key OW market at the global equity Level with a TOPIX base-case target price of 2600 (+4% upside) and a rising Likelihood of our bull case of 2800 (+12% upside) coming into play as fund re-allocations to Japan have been high year to date driving multiple expansion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For Japan at the sector level, all 17 Topix-17 sectors have posted positive returns YTD in local currency terms. The top 3 sectors include: Automobiles &amp;&nbsp;Transportation Equipment, Commercial &amp;&nbsp;Wholesale Trade and Energy Resources. The bottom three performing sectors are Raw Materials &amp;&nbsp;Chemicals, Electric Appliances &amp;&nbsp;Precision Instruments and Steel &amp;&nbsp;Nonferrous Metals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">MSCI EM, on the other hand, has remained weak at the index level with YTD performance of -6.1%, following subdued absolute and relative performance in 2023. Within EM markets, the top three performers are Turkey, Egypt, Colombia; in contrast, Korea, Chile, Hong Kong were the bottom three performing markets. Within EM sectors, all sectors have delivered negative absolute returns YTD. Materials, Real Estate and Consumer Discretionary are the worst three performers while Energy, Utilities and Financials are the best three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We reiterate our style call on o/w Quality and neutral between Value and Growth in EM. Our empirical study suggests marginal performance difference between Value/Growth and outperformance in Quality under a soft Landing scenario. We also summarize the Latest YTD 2024 factor performance. Please refer to our Latest Biweekly Perspectives: Fed Pivot Playbook For Asia/EM Equities in 2024.</span></p>
