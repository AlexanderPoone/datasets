<p><span class="font7">EM Edge economies performed better than expected through mid 2023: financial buffers have either been built or will be left intact, except for a few cases. Domestic reforms focused on reduction of subsidies and primary balance consolidation got a boost from the reversion of the war-related commodity shock. Cooling food and energy inflation also brought relief to households. US resilience raised hopes of a global soft landing that added to the sense of a benign external environment. In addition, IMF and other lending stepped in to provide a backstop or direct lending for the needy. Consequently, funding gaps this year, where present are modest.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Against this challenging backdrop, we expect most frontiers will look to muddle through at best. EM Edge economies would resort to whittling down buffers, enduring imbalances, tapping multilateral lenders and could be forced into tougher policy choices in a stress event. External financing needs and sources (GXFN) are a critical piece of this analytical puzzle. With this mind, in this note we conduct our first take on 2024 external financing needs and sources for the EM Edge economies. For the hill tables of the numbers discussed in this report, </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">please see the EM Edge Data Watch</span><span class="font7">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">In the aggregate, the median excess funding (or reserve build) for EM Edge falls from 0.6% of GDP in 2023 to 0.5% (and 0.4% ex. GCC) next year. However, as we argued in our 2023 updates, there are a few cases that warrant concern yet. The largest external gaps are forecast in Ecuador, Kenya, and Uzbekistan—each with unique drivers. In Ecuador’s case, while debt service steps up modestly next year due to higher payments on its IMF loans, the deterioration in its fiscal outlook adds about 1% of GDP to GXFN. Lacking market access and without an IMF program in hand, Ecuador would lean further on its reserve stock. Kenya can count on multilaterals and loans next year to partly fund its large twin deficits. Yet, as market access remains elusive, we expect the country to further drain reserves to pay its upcoming 2024 maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Finally, the negative funding gap in Uzbekistan partly reflects falling remittances inflows and partly an overheated economy that pressures imports and the CA.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">However most frontiers have not directly benefitted from US outperformance as China’s unsteady growth is more pressing. Indeed, while recession fears in early 2023 kept long-term yields and the dollar at bay, they also kept investors away. Since July, markets have repriced rates and the dollar higher amid this outperformance. Oil prices rose too, largely on supply factors. This is a concerning combination for frontiers, and EM more broadly as we look into 2024. Still, we are not anticipating the 2024 funding picture to get markedly worse for Edge economies. Ten out of 24 frontier names (rated B or below) had already lost market access and we expect this to persist. However, the funding squeeze could be extended and to more frontiers on higher US rates/dollar along with elevated oil prices. Our top down bias remains that a 2024 US recession is more likely than not.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Our assumptions that stressed cases like Pakistan and Egypt will close funding gaps rest on the view that IMF program implementation proceeds or resumes that unlocks IMF and related funding. In Tunisia, IMF negotiations have stalled; we assume funding is agreed next year, but recognize it is a close call. Global variables such as the trajectory of long-term yields and oil prices have an important bearing on the outlook for market-access countries, but less so for the stressed names.</span></p>
