<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Supply chains still a headwind, though company-specific issues largely resolved. </span><span class="font7">Nearly all companies discussed global slupping pricing and logistical constraints as a continued headwind, though with varying degrees of impact depending on contractual arrangements and manufacturing locations. Polysilicon and steel pricing has declined from its late-21 highs, but remains significantly elevated compared to recent years (see further detail on polysilicon below). Other key raw materials pricing also remains significantly elevated, in some cases exacerbated by the Russia/Ukraine conflict (e.g. nickel, litliium, copper). As a result. BNEF expects solar prices to remain elevated during FY22, despite polysilicon supply ramping during 2H22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Generally, longer project cycles have had more significant issues with supply chain headwinds, as project pricing and margins determined in the past (in some cases measured in years), are negatively by current elevated input costs. As a result, upstream product companies with exposure to utility-scale have been generally more impacted, wliile residential projects, with timing measured in weeks/months. are generally more immune as elevated input costs are passed on to end-customers via recently signed contracts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Polysilicon update. </span><span class="font7">Polysilicon accounts for ~40% of solar module costs. Wliile BNEF forecasts the polysilicon market returning to an oversupply scenario in 2H22 as new factories come online, it forecasts polysilicon prices remaining between $25-35 per kilogram for the full year (~$33/kg currently), up from a prior forecast of $20-25 per kilogram. BNEF projects Cliina will account for much of the additional supply; however, Xinjiang, under scrutiny owing to concerns around the use of forced labor, is expected to see its share of global poly silicon production drop from 49% in 2021 to 42% in 2022. We therefore estimate that Xinjiang is expected to account for just ~25% of incremental global polysilicon supply. We believe tliis should help alleviate project delays for US developers seeking to avoid risks associated with panel import detaimnents tied to the US govenunent’s Withhold Release Order (WRO).</span></p>
