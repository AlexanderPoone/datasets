<p><span class="font3">Mengniu changes CEO and multiple board members</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Mengniu announced changes to its management team on 15 Sep, noting that the CEO, Ms Sun Yiping, and three other board members have resigned. This is the second round of board member changes (first round in April 2016) after COFCO's management reshuffle in Jan 2016, which is the largest shareholder in Mengniu. The announcement also appoints Mr Jeffrey Lu, who is currently Yashili CEO, as Mengniu's new CEO and Ms Wu Wenting, who is China Foods' CFO, as Mengniu's new executive director. Mr Lu will continue to serve as Yashili CEO until the company finds a successor, while Ms Wu will no longer be China Foods' CFO.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In the conference call held on the morning of 19 Sep, the chairman Mr Ma Jianping noted that he appreciates Ms Sun's contribution to Mengniu over the past four years particularly in food safety enhancement, product upgrade and brand equity development. However, he also highlights the challenges ahead given Mengniu's sales scale is by far lagging behind its key peer (in 2015, Yili's sales were cRmb60b vs Mengniu's cRmb47b; in 2011, both companies had similar size of cRmb37b). The board expects the new appointments to help Mengniu achieve its goal with RmblOOb revenue size by 2020.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">We believe it is encouraging to see Mr Lu take over the CEO role given his experience of fast moving consumer products in various multinational corporations such as Danone, Johnson &amp;&nbsp;Johnson and GE Company. We also believe his background from Danone can enhance the collaboration with regard to product innovation and quality control. We maintain our OW rating and expect the margin expansion path to continue aided by product upgrade, mix change and efficiency improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Other takeaways from the conference call on 19 Sep are as follows.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COFCO will have three representatives on Mengniu's board while Danone and Aria each will have one representative on Mengniu's board. COFCO currently has representatives including chairman Ma Jianping as non-executive director and Wu Wenting as executive director. It will appoint another nonexecutive later depending on the expertise Mengniu requires at the moment. Each of Danone (Mr Filip Kegels) and Aria (Mr. Tim Orting Jorgensen) has one seat in non-executive director too.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mengniu's target to achieve the revenues scale of RmblOOb by 2020 is unchanged. The company will focus on three product categories (room temperature products, chilled products and milk powder) with aim to improve from four perspectives including: 1) R&amp;D, 2) operational efficiency, 3) optimization of distribution model and 4) profitability. To achieve the goal, the CEO Jeffery Lu notes organic growth is still the focus and guides the top line to grow at least HSD for the following years. In addition, he also notes the acquisition may be conducted in due course if necessary.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CEO Mr. Lu notes Mengniu will continue to closely work with Danone and Aria in: 1) product innovation, 2) quality control in upstream milk supply and efficiency enhancement, 3) global milk procurement and 4) establishment for a new research institute in China. Given his background and past experience, he believes he can help the synergy to be fully released.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman Ma believes the new executive director Wu Wenting can improve the company's corporate governance and the implementation of internal auditing practices. Besides, founder Niu Gensheng sitting in the board should help Mengniu formulate a new strategy for future growth based on his solid knowledge of the dairy industry.</span></p></li></ul>
