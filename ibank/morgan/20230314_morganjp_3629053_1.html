<p><span class="font4">The consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.4% in Febmary (0.370% to three decimals) while the core index increased 0.5% (0.452% to three decimals). These monthly changes were very close to our expectations although the core index came in a tenth above the consensus forecast when rounded to one decimal place. The year-ago inflation rates for the headline and core continued to moderate into Febmary from even stronger earlier figures, but the latest data show a Finn trend for inflation persisting into last month, and the monthly change in the core CPI for Febmary actually was the strongest change reported since September. Several Fed officials have been focusing on core services inflation ex. shelter/rent as an important gauge of the underlying inflation trend and this aggregate also looked firm in Febmary. The core sendees CPI excluding rent and OER rose 0.5% in Februaiy, also the firmest print since September. Overall, the recent inflation strength should keep pressure on the Fed to tighten policy as the FOMC heads into next week’s policy meeting, and we continue to look for a 25bp hike at the upcoming March meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some of the main underlying details of the report, energy prices declined 0.6% in Febmary while food prices increased 0.4%. Within the core measure (that excludes food and energy), goods prices continued to look soft, with basically no change inprices in Febmary, while sendees prices were firm again, rising 0.6% in Febmary. Within core services, Febmary showed firm inflation for the main rent measures (tenants’ rent: 0.76%, owners’ equivalent rent: 0.70%) as well as in a variety of other underlying categories. The persistent strength in core sendees inflation away from rent (which generally has come along with surprising continued tightness in the labor market) has been one of the main suiprises in the inflation data over the past few months. We do think that the underlying inflation trend will moderate over time, in part because of cooling in core services prices away from rent, but this slowing likely will require additional softening in the labor market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In some other CPI details of note, public transportation prices jumped 3.2% in Februaiy, incorporating a 6.4% surge in airfares. Prices for lodging away from home also increased notably in Februaiy, with a 2.3% monthly gain. On the softer side, used vehicle prices continued their recent downward trend, falling another 2.8% in January. With all of the data from the CPI now in hand, we think core PCE inflation is tracking 0.31% in Febmary (4.6% oya); tomorrow’s PPI release also will contain relevant related information.</span></p>
