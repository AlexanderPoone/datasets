<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">This week, we roll forward our dynamic weights to account for 2022 nominal GDP numbers. This report discusses how the weights have changed and any implications for our macroeconomic indicators. All of theJ.P. Morgan aggregates for 2022 and later are based on the new 2022 nominal GDP weights. Aggregates before 2022 arc based on their respective years weight, i.c., weights arc concurrent (vary over time).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The many global and regional macroeconomic indicators used by J.P. Morgan Economic Research are constructed using weights to aggregate economic concepts across countries. Given GDP’s central role in defining the business cycle and influencing financial markets, we almost always use nominal GDP weights as our marker for economic importance. These weights evolve over time and can be thought of as reflecting the influence economies have in driving global activity and markets. Once a year, we update these weights and this week we introduce weights to reflect the complete set of 2022 annual GDP data. Based on the revised weights, the forecasts for 2023 and 2024 growth on a year-average over year-average (y/y) basis are unchanged at 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Our estimate of global potential growth is unchanged at 2.3% through 2023 (down from 2.5% in 2022 owing to a 1%-point reduction in China’s potential growth).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The J.P. Morgan global GDP weights are market-based in that we convert nominal GDP values to a common currency (USD) using annual average market exchange rates. Another approach is to use purchasing power parity (PPP) exchange rates to convert to a common currency. As a ratio of the prices of like-for-like consumer baskets, PPP exchange rates better reflect activity in ha id-to-measure, non-tradable sectors (or in areas where the “law of one price” does not hold). But they are less useful for international financial and macroeconomic analysis. We report the full set of 2022 GDP weights (along</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with PPP-based weights for reference) in Table 1 at the end of this report. Also included in the table for reference are our estimates of real potential GDP growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to this update, we used the official nominal GDP data from 2021 for all our regional and global aggregates from 2021 forward. With a hill set of official nominal GDP data for 2022 in hand, all aggregates from 2022 forward will utilize these new weights (prioryears will continue to be based on the GDP figures from respective years).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As of 2022, the US is still the largest economy in our global aggregate with a weight of 28.4% (Figure 1). China (20.0%) further entrenched its position as the second-largest economy, with the Euro area (15.7%) in the third spot. China overtook the Euro area in 2019. Japan (4.7%) slots in at fourth. India (3.8%) edges out the UK (3.4%) for the final spot in the top five. Together, the top five economies account for nearly three-quarters of our global aggregate. The UK, Russia, Canada, Brazil, and Australia round out the top 10. Korea dropped out of the top 10 in 2022.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">US outperformance lifts 2022 weight</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Global GDP growth moderated to 2.9%y/y last year after surging 6.3% in 2021. Although 202 2 growth outcomes were more stable than the volatility of 2020 and 2021, the year was still remarkably turbulent, with the global economy buffeted by multiple adverse shocks. That the global expansion continued at an above-potential pace in the second hill year of the recovery from COVID-19 in the face of these supply shocks, fiscal drags, and various other headwinds was a testament to the strength of private sector fundamentals. The performance of the EM was particularly impressive last year, overcoming its usual sensitivity to global shocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The US outperformance over the past year is clear. The US experienced far and away the largest gain in nominal GDP share in 2022 (Figure 2). The US weight jumped 1.8%-pts from 2021 to 2022. The weight of Russia rose 0.4%-pt. Brazil, India, and Argentina—the economies that experienced the</span></p>
