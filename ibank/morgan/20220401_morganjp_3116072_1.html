<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Fundamental View Upbeat, but Inflation, Sentiment, and Valuations Temper Views on Stocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Our fundamental outlook for the P&amp;C sector is upbeat, but we feel that the riskreward in stocks is not compelling. From a long-term fundamental viewpoint, we are most constructive on brokers, but we feel that broker valuations are stretched. Fundamentals in the commercial lines business are healthy as well, but CPI and tort inflation are potential headwinds and stocks seem fully valued. Conversely, near-term results in personal lines should be weak, but we project margins to improve as 2022 progresses. Our long-tenn view of reinsurers remains cautious.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising EPS estimates. We are modestly raising EPS estimates to reflect lower than previously assumed cat losses (1Q22) and the rise in interest rates (2022 and 2023). We feel that consensus 1Q22 projections for cat-exposed firms are too low (ACGL, ALL, HIG, RNR, and TRV), while those for brokers are too high (AON, MMC). For 2022, we are generally above consensus on domestic-focused companies (ALL, HIG, PGR) and below on reinsurers (ACGL, RNR) and firms exposed to the stronger USS (AON, CB, MMC).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect business trends in IQ to be fairly healthy, but vary by segment. </span><span class="font6">We forecast brokers to report expanding margins and steady, but slowing, organic growth. Commercial insurers’ marginsand premiums should improve as well, helped by continued firm pricing. Reinsurers’ margins are likely to expand also, but at a slower pace than last year. Meanwhile, we project personal lines margins to be weak in 1Q22, but improve as the year progresses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management commentary on pricing should be upbeat, but discussions of loss trends are likely to be cautious. </span><span class="font6">We expect commercial lines prices to stay firm, but project reinsurance pricing to moderate. Conversely, personal lines prices should continue to rise as insurers strive to revive auto insurance margins. High used car prices present a headwind for personal auto margins, while CPI and tort inflation could cause an uptick in commercial and reinsurance claims.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuations appear stretched. </span><span class="font6">The JPM P&amp;C Underwriter Index is currently at 1.4x BV, up from 1.2x a year ago and above its historical average of l.lx. On P/E, the group is at 14x forward EPS, up from 13x at 1/1/21 and the historical level of 12x. Brokers are at 26x adjusted EPS, also well above 17x historically.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ALL and HIG are our top picks, but both are less compelling than earlier in the year. </span><span class="font6">We believe that ALL has near-term macro catalysts (improvement in personal auto prices and margins) and long-term micro catalysts (uptick in PIF growth) that should lift earnings as well as drive an expansion in its valuation multiple. Conversely, we remain negative on RNR due to secular headwinds facing the reinsurance market in the long run and an expected slowing of price hikes in the near term. Among our Neutral-rated stocks, we are most constructive on CB. Meanwhile, although our long-term view of AON (Neutral) is positive, we are concerned about a slowdown in organic growth, overly optimistic consensus forecasts, and the stock’s valuation.</span></p>
