<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Investment Risks</span></h4>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Highly regulated healthcare service industry with rising competition &amp;&nbsp;increasing acquisition cost</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fosun will continue to consolidate the fragmented hospitals industry by acquiring general and/or specialty hospitals. In China, various regulatory approvals are required before a private company can build or acquire hospitals, although the government is encouraging private capital investment in the hospital segment. Furthermore, other companies such as pharmaceutical manufacturers, private equity firms and hospital managem ent groups also chase hospitals acquisitions, which will increase M&amp;A valuation multiples, in our view. In addition, Fosun could face rising risk as it develops international businesses and M&amp;A, with greater exposure to different company and country cultures and regulatory regimes.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Price cut pressure on key products</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In recent years, the government has undertaken multiple rounds of price cuts on drugs in order to reduce the burden of healthcare insurance reimbursement plans. There are also ongoing rounds of provincial tenders of drugs, which will further reduce drug margins to very low levels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Large capital needs and longer investment period for green-field hospitals </span><span class="font2">Establishing green field hospitals or expansion of existing facilities require large capital investment and longer repayment period, e.g it requires at least Rmb600mn-700mn for building a specialty hospital which will take 2-3 years to complete and another 3-4 years to break even. Thus, hospital sendees yields lower returns compared to other subsectors.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Uncertainty or delay of new product pipeline</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The R&amp;D for new drugs takes a long time and involves execution risks going through the CFDA approval process. Pipeline failure almost always poses at least a temporaiy disruption because it deprives a company of a future potential revenue contributor. Therefore, the stock price may become volatile if there are setbacks or delay in its pipeline.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Discount as a holding company by investors</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fosun has a complicated corporate structure with various subsidiaries. Some investors think it is a private equity company rather than a pharmaceutical company, thus think it should trade at a discount to other peers. Yet, we think it deserves rerating as Fosun takes more steps to improve its product offerings with an increased R&amp;D focus.</span></p>
