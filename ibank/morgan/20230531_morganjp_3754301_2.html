<p><span class="font7">More than a year after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the war has permanently reshaped the global commodity markets. The worst-case scenarios haven’t come to pass, but the impact is apparent on every facet of the market, from shifting energy flows to pricing fragmentation and de-dollarization to surge in gold allocations in FX reserves.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Shifting commodity flows</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The immediate and most visible catalyst of the Ukraine war was Russia’s re-routing of its energy exports away from Europe and towards the East and the South. Russia appears to be strategic in its goals, pursuing a three-pronged strategy where the country is looking to build new trade routes that do not pass through waters controlled by the West, de-dollarize its energy exports, while also opening new markets to diversify away from China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Before the Ukraine war, Russia shipped about 50% of its total oil exports (seaborne and pipeline) and 74% of its gas exports (pipeline and LNG) to Europe. One year on, that figure slipped to less than 5% in oil and 34% in gas. Due to competitive landed costs and existing infrastructure, Russia was suc-cessful in finding new customers for its oil and Russian exports have continued to flow at close to pre-war volumes </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Figure 1). </span><span class="font7">China has boosted its purchases of Russian gas— including LNG and gas by pipelines—by more than 40% in 2022, while reducing LNG imports from Australia by 30%. But given the large mismatch between Russia’s extensive gas export pipeline network to Europe and constrained eastward pipeline capacity to Asia, rerouted gas supplies to China have so far proven unable to compete with pre-war exports to the European Union, impacting production </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exhibit 2).</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">Until Februaiy 2022, Russia was the world’s leading exporter of gas—shipping 205 Bcm of gas via pipelines and 40 Bcm of liquefied natural gas in 2021—far above the US and Qatar. But unlike its competitors, three-quarters of Russia’s gas exports were concentrated in a single market: Europe. In the five years before the Ukrainian war, flows of Russian gas (both piped and LNG) to the EU were relatively stable, averaging around 190 Bcm and accounting for about 50% of total European gas imports. That had dropped to just 19% by February 2023, when Russia exported only about 4.6 Bcm of gas to Europe via pipelines through Ukraine and Turkey </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Figure 3). </span><span class="font7">Only Russian LNG continues to flow uninterrupted to EU countries </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(Figure 4).</span></p>
