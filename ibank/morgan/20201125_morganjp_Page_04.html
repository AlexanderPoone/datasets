<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We expect the current account deficit to narrow sharply next year. </span><span class="font3">Turkey’s 12-month trailing current account balance worsened sharply from a surplus of 1.1% of GDP to a deficit of 3.9% of GDP in the first nine months of the year. Approximately half of that deterioration was due to significantly higher gold imports (reflecting increased nervousness that resulted in high gold demand by locals) and the other half was due to the pandemic-related plunge in tourism and transportation revenues. In fact, excluding gold imports and tourism and transportation revenues, Turkey’s external balances have been roughly stable, disproving worries over an overheating economy. More prudent policies and higher interest rates will likely reduce the gold demand sharply while weaker domestic demand and increased price competitiveness caused by the lira weakening sharply in the first part of this year will likely lead to a significant improvement in Turkey’s external balances. Even with a partial recovery in tourism and travel, we see the current account deficit narrowing from an expected US$28.8 billion (4.2% of GDP) US$8.6 billion (1.2% of GDP) in 2021.A more meaningful recovery in tourism could even result in a current account surplus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Turkish businesses have reduced their leverage, but external debt repayments still remain high. </span><span class="font3">This deleveraging was partly voluntary and partly imposed by market conditions but made easier by the current account. In particular, the corporate sector reduced its FX borrowing from the banking system, which, in turn, was a net payer of foreign debt. The short FX position of the corporate sector fell to US$162 billion from US$222 billion over the last two years. It is a relief that such rapid deleveraging did not destabilize the economy. However, Turkey’s total external debt maturing over the next twelve months still stands at US$170 billion and this leaves little room for policy mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Fiscal policy has been relatively successful but the Treasury's redemption schedule remains heavy. </span><span class="font3">Despite weaker growth and COVID-19 related fiscal measures, the widening in the budget deficit has been quite muted: to 3.6% of GDP from 2.9% in the first nine months of the year. Continued spending discipline has been the main factor behind this. We see the budget deficit narrowing to 3.8% of GDP next year from an expected 4.3% in 2020. Despite this, the treasury’s total financing requirement will likely remain high due to the short maturity of recent borrowing and the resulting increase in principal payments coming due next year.</span></p>
