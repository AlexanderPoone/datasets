<p><span class="font2">Northbound net outflows totaled US$2.3bn during January TI-17, continuing the overall outflow trend since August 2023: Northbound MTD total net outflows reached US$3.6bn, while Southbound recorded net inflows of US$1.1bn during January 11-17, bringing total MTD net inflows to US$2.6bn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Market sentiment remained lackluster as macro prints remain weak under deflation pressure: China's GDP grew ~5.2% in 2023, while real GDP growth softened to a subpar 4.1% QoQ annualized amid weakness in the industrial and service sectors. December 2023 CPI and PPI prints confirmed that the economy is in the deepest and Longest deflation cycle since 1998, with core CPI unchanged at 0.6% Y for the second month and non-commodity PPI dipping sequentially for the third month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile, Loan demand weakened YoY in December owing to Lackluster home purchases and corporate capex demand amid a deflationary environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our latest China Free Liquidity Indicator dipped meaningfully in December and we think the tight Liquidity trend could persist in the next 12 months.</span></p>
