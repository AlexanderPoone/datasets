<p><span class="font6">In some fundamental sense, this discussion abstracts from key issues related to underlying structures which are sometimes placed at the center of the discussion of where r* stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">These forces to generally continue to lean in the direction of lower neutral policy rates, particularly as our estimates of potential growth have continued to drift lower (Figure 9). However, we would emphasize that for the horizon that is relevant for central bank decisions over the coming two years, the business cycle forces at play are likely to prove dominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The rub: Change matters</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While neutral estimates reflect the level of policy consistent with stable utilization rates, changes in policy stances have significant independent effects on activity. The dramatic changes in monetary policy stances over the past year therefore has the potential to have a large impact on economic performance (Figure 10). With the DM central banks expected to cumulatively raise policy rates by roughly 400bp from their 2021 lows, the impulse from this shift will be a far greater immediate factor in determining near-term outcomes than the gap that has opened from the level of neutral rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">This point is reinforced by a range of US model estimates that suggest that a sustained lOObp rise in Fed policy rates should depresses US GDP by at least 1%-pts over the course of six quarters. Viewed in this context there is a high probability that a roughly 500bp rise in Fed policy rates throws the US economy into recession. The change in monetary conditions during this tightening cycle reinforces this point as DM bond yields have moved up faster and cumulatively further than in any tightening cycle experienced since the early 1980s . G-4 bank lending standards are also tightening materially in a manner consistent with early slides into recession (Figure 11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">If this large tightening pushes economies into recession this year, then it will take sometime to disentangle the issue of whether real neutral policy rates remain close to zero. However, if the global economy m aintains its balance, withstanding a tightening in monetary conditions that would be normally expected to generate recession, it would reinforce the view that neutral policy rates have moved materially higher.</span></p>
