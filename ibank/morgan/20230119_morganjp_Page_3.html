<p><span class="font4">note that periods of overfunding status typically happened before recessions such as in 2000, 2007, and 2019 (so hit rates of monthly observations should be taken with a grain of salt). Outperformance of bonds over stocks comes from both equities moving lower (5%, 10% and 15%) and rally in bonds (1%, 4%, and 6%) over the subsequent period (3, 6, and 9 months).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Aside from the impact of defined benefit plan rebalancing, other long term multi-asset portfolios are likely to rebalance from equities to bonds (e.g. defined contribution plans, wealth funds, etc.). This is simply a consequence of bonds looking more attractive vs equities after a long time of suppressed yields. It is not possible to precisely know the size of these rebalances, but we can get a sense based on various models of expected returns and optimal allocation. One framework is our 3- and 5-year asset return forecast model (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">here)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font4">that suggest bonds should outperform stocks in the coming years. Using these long-term estimates in a Black-Litterman portfolio construction method, indicates equities allocations should be lower by —8% and bond allocations higher by 13%. If these allocations were to be implemented, it would represent equity outflows around double the size of those expected from defined benefit plans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Finally, if the equity selloff and bond rally were to happen, another question is what should be the timing of it. Most economists expect a recession late this year or in 2024, and large crises tend to play out over 2-3 year time horizon. The current crisis (rates, inflation, slowdown) is already lasting for over a year and markets tend to anticipate and accelerate economic developments. We do want to note that market crises tend to evolve in a non-linear fashion and eventually result in central banks reversing policies (when markets can start recovering from sufficiently low valuations). Non-linear trajectory, informally known as ‘gradually then suddenly’, happens because of contagion between various parts of the market. Currently, there are a number of potential segments that are at risk due to a combination of secular trends, the unprecedented rise in interest rates, and economic slowdown. These include commercial real estate, venture capital, private equity, crypto markets, and stock holdings popular with retail. Additionally, there are risks of a re-emergence of the energy crisis, earnings recession, and geopolitical escalations. A further issue is the very low liquidity in both equities and bonds. After an initial improvement in 2021 (likely related to rates and QE), liquidity fell last year and remains at historically low levels, and recently did not materially improve with declining market volatility.</span></p>
