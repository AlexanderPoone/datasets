<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expect another strong year for semiconductors with solid Y/Y revenue growth and further upward revisions to EPS through 2022 supported by continued macro strength and sustained demand growth drivers compounded by a meaningful supply-demand gap and pricing power that should provide further uplift into 2023. </span><span class="font2">As we outlined in our 2022 outlook note (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font2">), we expect further upside in semiconductor stocks in 2022 as the market continues to positively discount sustained strong industry fundamentals coupled with tight supply chain dynamics that should drive continued positive EPS revisions (we see another 15-20%+ upside to out-year EPS estimates). We believe aggregate demand continues to be above trend-line in most sectors and chip shortages will likely not start to normalize until the 2H of this year. From the November SIA data (see note </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font2">), 4Q21 is tracking to a 5% Q/Q growth and above nonnal seasonal trends. We believe the fundamental setup that drove strong semiconductor industry revenue expansion in 2021 (up 24% Y/Y) remains in place for 2022 and we forecast semi industry revenue growth of 10%+ and earnings growth of 15-18%. In-line with this, we expect 2022 wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending to increase 15%+ Y/Y (following -40% Y/Y in 2021) driven by continued foundry/logic strength and rising capital intensity tailwinds. On the supply side, chip inventories in the channel are 30-50% below pre Covid-19 levels and 15-35% below historical levels at direct customers.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We estimate that 4Q21 book-to-bill for the industry continued to be greater than one and better results will be reflective of continued cloud/datacenter strength, recovery in enterprise, seasonal smartphone strength augmented by 5G adoption, an acceleration of 5G infrastructure deployments, and solid auto/industrial </span><span class="font2">demand. In aggregate, we expect overall group revenue/eamings results in 4Q21 will be in-line to better as broad-based demand strength was supported by a seasonally stronger quarter for smartphones and consumer. Starting with the SIA data, November industry Y/Y sales trends showed continued strong Y/Y growth on strong demand and pricing power. 4Q21 is tracking to 5% Q/Q (vs season trends of flattish% Q/Q). The global PMI in December was 54.2, the eighteenth consecutive month of above 50 PMI (&gt;50 signals expansion) since emerging out of the COVID-19 lockdowns in 2Q20. After a year-plus of various exogenous pressures on auto production from semiconductor supply constraints to COVID-19 disruptions in SE Asia, which have resulted in a series of negative production cuts, these headwinds have now stabilized. Auto production is now expected to increase 23.4% Q/Q in 4Q21 (.ABOVE the seasonal trend of +10%) and with gradual improvement as we move through 2022. Overall, we anticipated strong'sustained demand trends across most end-markets will be reflected in Dec-Q results and while revenue upside will likely again be somewhat capped by supply chain constraints, we continue to see our companies exercising pricing power to help drive earnings higher.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">semiconductor coverage as companies overcome seasonal weakness with continued strong end demand, pricing power, and moderately improving supply. </span><span class="font2">Despite entering a typically weaker period for semiconductors in general, we expect overall group revenue/eamings outlooks will be better than seasonal trends as we continue to see sustained broad-based demand strength compounded by continued supply constraints across most end-markets that served to push unfilled demand from 2021 into this year. In datacenter, cloud hyperscale customer spending trends continue to inflect solidly at the beginning of the year with continued strength expected throughout 2022 (up 30%+ in 2022). Auto/industrial trends remain strong and continue to improve on incremental capacity additions. In 5G infrastructure, we anticipate that</span></p>
