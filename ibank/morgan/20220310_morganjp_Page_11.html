<p><span class="font3">Financing risk. </span><span class="font4">The company’s growth depends on its ability to raise capital from third-party investors to fund investment in the rooftop solar systems and storage that support the provision of the Sunnova customer sendee, so disruption to the capital markets could slow the firm’s growth prospects relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Competition. </span><span class="font4">Sunnova faces head-on competition from other residential solar sendee companies, including Sunrun (RUN/OW) and a host of regional and local companies. As the market matures, competition for customers could lead to depressed pricing and diminishing returns on investments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Market risk. </span><span class="font4">Residential solar market growth could slow relative to expectations or shift toward homeowners making outright cash purchases that bypass the lease, PPA, and loan options.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Key personnel risk. </span><span class="font4">Loss of key executives for this lean organization could lead to execution challenges and weakening of relationships with the dealer network.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Policy and regulatory risk. </span><span class="font4">Federal, state, and local authorities are positioned to terminate or retroactively reverse tax credits, renewable energy credits, and other incentives or impose charges on rooftop solar customers that want to connect to the grid, which could impede growth relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Credit risk. </span><span class="font4">In adverse economic circumstances, it is possible that Sunnova’s customers could be late in paying their electricity bills or stop paying altogether, weighing on cash flow from operations, relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Costs could increase. </span><span class="font4">Solar equipment costs, EPC costs, and rising interest rates could lead to higher system costs, which could slow adoption relative to expectations.</span></p>
