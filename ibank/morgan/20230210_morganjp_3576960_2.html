<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the recent heavy main rity schedule, bank CP/CD supply has remained light. Spreads have continued their trek tighter and could fu it her tighten on the margin into Marek though they’re unlikely to reach the lows seen early last year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After flattening most of January, the T-bill curve has steepened by about 16bp MID, likely on the back of resistance to extend out the curve given recent hawkishness and uncertainty on the timing of the drop-dead date</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ~$300bn in net T-bill supply that entered the market YTD contributed to a meaningful drop in ON RRP of around $250bn YTD (excl. year-end)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank borrowings from FHLBs increased by $379bn in 2022 to $566bn, driven predominately by small banks, followed by regional banks and I S G-SIBs</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FHLB borrowing by con nterparty is concentrated. The top 25 banks with the largest FHLB advance balances make up 56% of total FHLB bank borrowings and contributed to 62% of the growth last year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cou nterparties with the largest FHLB advance balances tend to be regional banks and US G-SIBs</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font3">Market moves this week seemed to have capitulated to the Fed view that rates will be higher for longer and that a pivot might not necessarily come as soon as some might expect. Front-end Treasury yields, the most sensitive sector to near-term monetary policy expectations, rose this week. In particular, 2y Treasury yields increased 2 Ibp week over week to 4.51%. OIS forwards also moved farther into restrictive territory, with the peak funds rate now priced at nearly 5.19% versus 5.03% on Friday 2/3 and 4.89% on Thursday 2/2 (pre jobs report), and the OIS curve in 2H23 steepened by ~15bp since Thursday 2/2 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exhibit 1). </span><span class="font3">This is now more in line withour economists’ expectations of 25bp rate hikes in March and May and a terminal range of 5.00-5.25%, though we continue to diverge slightly from markets in terms of Fed expectations in late 2023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">To be sure, this week’s Fedspeak was decidedly hawkish </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exhibit 2). </span><span class="font3">Chair Powell spoke on Tuesday, reiterating his talking points from the recent Fed meeting: disinflation has begun but still has a long way to go, and further interest rate increases are likely needed (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Go your own </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;text-decoration:underline;">hw</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font3"> M. Feroli, 2/7/23). Warning that a continuing strong labor market could mean a higher funds rate peak, Powell once again stressed policy’s dependence on data. Other Fed officials echoed a similar-sentiment, generally asserting that the Fed has more work to do to curb inflation and that rates will likely need to remain higher for longer. To that end, initial claims for the week ending February 4 increased 13K to 196K—the first weekly increase since mid-December, but still very low and indicative of continued strength in the labor-market—continuing to backup hawkish Fed sentiment (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">US: Initial claims mow up but stay very low</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font3"> D. Silver, 2/9/23). Next week’s CPI print for January will further shed light on whether there is more work for the Fed to do.</span></p>
