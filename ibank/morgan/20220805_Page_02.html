<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Cost optimization starts to bear fruit</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Despite the fact that Alibaba's margin and profit surprised us in Jun quarter 2022, we expect more upside in the coming quarters as 1) a 10% YoY decline of core-core customer management revenue (CMR) in June quarter led to RMB4-5b EBITA YoY decline; and 2) Taocaicai's loss increased moderately YoY due to a low base in June quarter 2021. We believe these two drags will have less negative impact in September Q 2022, as the core CMR revenue returned to flattish YoY performance while Taocaicai's loss already began to narrow QoQ this quarter and its YoY comparison base will become easier in September quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alibaba's cost optimization efforts already demonstrated a good boost on its profit if we look beyond the negative impact from CMR and Taocaicai: 1) local consumer services EBITA narrowed by RMB 1.7b or 36% YoY to RMB3b<sub>5</sub> with Ele.me's unit economics turning positive; and 2) combined loss of Taobao Deals and Freshippo also narrowed by RMB 1.5b YoY. With the cost optimization efforts continuing to cut the loss QoQ across most business lines for Alibaba, the YoY loss narrowing will become even better, in our view, supporting its adjusted profit to positive growth YoY in December Q FY22 (or as early as in September Q), and 20%+ growth in CY2023. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Core-core revenue will stabilize</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">In June quarter, a 10% YoY decline of the core-core CMR revenue was driven by mid-single digit YoY decline of paid GMV, while the commission revenue declined by mid-teens YoY given order cancelation during the lockdown period, and marketing revenue's YoY decline was slightly better than the paid GMV YoY trend, according to the management.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Management commented that the recovery continued in July vs. the performance in June. With Alibaba's GMV during the 618 period already turning positive YoY, we believe its GMV in June should only decline modestly YoY in the worst case scenario, if we assume the performance after 618 was weak. In this case, its GMV in July should be largely flat YoY (from slightly positive to slightly negative YoY), and without the abnormal order cancelation, CMR YoY change should be more in line with GMV. Hence, we project CMR to increase modestly by 1% YoY in Sep quarter, which already turned positive despite the market's concerns about its market loss given the intense competition from Douyin, etc. As demand for more discretionaiy items, such as apparel, hasn't fully recovered yet, we expect further tailwinds for CMR growth to improve further to low to mid-single-digit YoY in Dec Q 2022.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe a recovery in core revenue should ease investor concerns on the topline. We would suggest investors re-focus on Alibaba's 20%+ bottom-line growth in FY2024E, which could suggest valuation upside against its CY2023E PE (at low teens now).</span></p>
<h5><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Cloud</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Cloud revenue was up by 10% YoY in June quarter 2022, decelerated from 13% YoY in March quarter 2022. Such YoY growth deceleration was mainly due to demand weakness from internet customers (a top internet customer stopped using the Alibaba overseas cloud business for its international businesses since Dec quarter 2021, and the YoY decline cloud usage from online education and other internet</span></p>
