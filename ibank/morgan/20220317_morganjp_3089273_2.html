<p><span class="font2">Water Utilities</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The water and wastewater utilities industry is highly fragmented in the U.S. Only -15% of the water utilities and less than 5% of the wastewater utilities in the U.S. are investor owned, while the rest are owned by public stakeholders. The need for capital investment in the industry is substantial, as much of the infrastructure was built over fifty years ago. Aging infrastructure not only causes substantial water loss, but also poses significant safety risks for customers. While it is costly for municipalities that operate small water systems to replace pipelines, an increasingly supportive regulatory backdrop<sup>1</sup> has made it easier for investor-owned water utilities to consolidate and benefit from economies of scale. Meanwhile, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law passed in Nov 2021 provides up to $55bn for water/wastewater infrastiucture, reflecting strong legislative support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We are initiating coverage of AWK and WTRG, both with a Neutral rating. We acknowledge the low-risk characteristics of water utilities, and the favorable timely recovery mechanisms in most of AWK and WTRG’s jurisdictions. However, we see limited opportunities for the water names to tighten materially from current levels, relative to some of the higher quality regulated names such as XEL. In addition, higher quality regulated utilities have more growth avenues and opportunities to build upon their credit quality relative to the water subsector, which primarily relies on a consolidation strategy. We also see the 15bp spread between AWK and WTRG to be fair. While the regulatory environment for water and gas will likely remain strong and supportive in WTRG’s main jurisdiction Pennsylvania, AWK is better positioned as a pure-play water business with a larger asset portfolio, manageable acquisition appetite, and more geographic diversity.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">American Water Works Company, Inc. (AWK) is the largest US investor-owned water and wastewater utility holding company based in Camden, New Jersey. The company conducts the majority (-86% of revenue) of its business<sup>2</sup> through its regulated segment, providing water, wastewater and other related services to 3.4 million customers across 14 states. On the other hand, its market-based business, Military Services Group (MSG), enters into long-term contracts with the U.S. government to provide water and wastewater services on 17 military installations.</span></p>
