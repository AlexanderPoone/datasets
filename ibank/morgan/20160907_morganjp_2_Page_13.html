<p><span class="font2">The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most regulated in China as the industry is not well understood by the general public and can be prone to abuses that could lead to significant financial waste and in serious cases, loss of life. A major overhaul in recent years has made drug development and approval more costly and time consuming. This could lead to a lower rate of introduction of new products but a higher likelihood of success of approved products. There is also a trend to regulate volume and profits from the sale of drugs by hospitals to patients. Sinopharm is indirectly impacted by many of the new rules and regulations in the ongoing healthcare reforms and this is a risk to the company’s operations, in our view.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>More price cuts from government</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Chinese government has been open about its desire to cut overall drug costs by at least 10-20% with the implementation of the Essential Drug List (EDL). We believe further price cuts are inevitable. Although Sinopharm is the largest drug distributor and holds more bargaining power than others, this power is still quite modest, because a drug manufacturer can readily find another distributor. Given the government’s tight hold on drug pricing, profit margins may easily be subject to government pricing pressure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Large working capital requirements/with longer account receivable days </span><span class="font2">Excluding cash, inventories and receivables make up over 70% of Sinopharm’s assets. The management of working capital is a critical success factor for Sinopharm. We expect sales to grow by nearly 30% a year and that requires a significant amount of working capital. Over the next few years, we expect a majority of the operating cash flows of the company would be needed to fund a rising level of working capital. Although we have not seen significant provisions for inventories and receivables in the past, such high balances do add an element of risk for provisions in the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sinopharm distributes most of its products to large Class III (or Tier 1 hospitals), which are public hospitals reliant on government subsidies. Thus, many of them usually delay the payment, resulting in longer A/R days. Sinopharm is adjusting their revenue mix/review payment for its customers to improve account receivable balance, e.g. account receivable balance decreased by 2.2% YoY in 2015. We expect Sinopharm to continue to factor some account receivable to meet working capital needs in the future. This may impact its overall profitability.</span></p>
