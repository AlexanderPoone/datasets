<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Share price support from major shareholder; reiterate OW as various positive catalysts on the horizon</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As expected, Wheelock disclosed the share purchase in Wharf to 60% of issued shares. We believe Wheelock will continue the stake increase exercise and support Wharf’s share price. In addition, we believe the expected moderation of retail sales decline in Hong Kong and potential restructuring of Wharf’s CME division will turn Wharf into an outperformer. Wharf remains our top pick in the Hong Kong property space. Stay OW.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wheelock supporting Wharf's share price via stake increases. </span><span class="font4">According to HKEx, Wheelock’s stake in Wharf reached 60.0% on April 18 as the company purchased Wharf s shares in the open market. The company has increased the pace of share purchases as Wharf s share price corrected last year amid the weakening retail sales outlook in HK. As highlighted before, we believe the best use of the disposal proceeds by Wheelock from selling Wheelock House is to purchase Wharf s shares which are trading at a 58% discount to book value. This would allow Wheelock to increase its exposure to the same asset at a discounted valuation, as Wheelock House was sold at fair valuation to Wharf last month. Assuming Wheelock purchased Wharfs shares with the proceeds at an average price of HK$42 since the last disclosure of interest at 59.1% in Dec-15. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Wheelock can still buy another HK$5 bn of Wharfs shares,</span><span class="font4"> which is equivalent to 3.9% of total shares at HK$42/sh, without increasing its net debt. It is likely the stake increase exercise will continue, in our view, which we believe will provide support to Wharf s share price in the near term.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moderation of HK retail sales decline to kick start soon. </span><span class="font4">Other than support from the major shareholder, we believe the potential moderation of the retail sales decline in HK will alter the overly bearish expectations of the market on Wharf. As discussed in our sector report </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">&quot;Honx Kong Propertv: Rising stock prices on falling property prices?”</span><span class="font4"> dated April 8, 2016, we believe a retail sales decline of 7-10% this year is a more realistic expectation rather than the over 30% decline as implied in Wharfs share price. As the low-base effect starts kicking in from March onwards, the narrowing of retail sales decline from 13.6% in 2M16 will bring positive momentum to the stock, in our view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Potential restructuring of CME division to realise value of Wharf T&amp;T. </span><span class="font4">Even though i-CABLE will receive the free TV licence in HK. it is indeed difficult for the company to compete with PCCW and TVB, in our view, given limited scale and intense competition. We believe the strategic review of the CME division by Wharf does not necessarily mean disposal but likely involves different strategic options. In any case, we believe the bulk of the value will come from Wharf T&amp;T which recorded FY15 EBITDA at HK$776 mn. At lOx EV/EBITDA, as implied from the recent acquisition of NWTHL by HKBN, the valuation of Wharf T&amp;T could reach HK$7.8 bn. We believe the potential restructuring could, therefore, help the market realise the value of Wharf T&amp;T which is embedded inside the property giant.</span></p></li></ul>
