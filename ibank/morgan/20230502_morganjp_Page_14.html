<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Long-term trends in Turkiye: Mean reversion or trend following? (I)</span></h5>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">MSCI Turkiye has been on a long-term downtrend, both in index performance and in USD earnings-at least until last year. </span><span class="font4">From a long-term perspective, MSCI Turkiye is a mean-reversion dream. Or a trap to avoid for investors who expect the current negative trends to continue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The performance of MSCI Turkiye in USD terms from Jan ‘10, i.e. just after the end of the GFC, to now is -5% CAGR </span><span class="font4">Losing 5% every year is a poor trend of equity investors. The trend line - and MSCI Turkiye is well above the trendline - shows a -10% CAGR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">When we look at earnings, we see that since Jan ‘10, USD earnings are up small, by 3% CAGR since Jan ‘ 10, but more than all of that has come in the last 12m. </span><span class="font4">USD EPS from Jan ‘ 10 to the trough in Dec ‘21 was -68% overall or -9% CAGR. We wonder if the strong reversal in earnings is lasting. If the JPM TRY forecast of 25 by end-’23 is correct or we use a TRY of 26.9 to reverse the recent real appreciation, then we think USD earnings will be down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking at Turkiye vs. EM as a relative trade, it has lost 5% CAGR since Jan ‘10 or 47% overall. </span><span class="font4">And that includes Tiirkiye’s world-beating‘22 performance, +88%, miles ahead of Chile which rose+12% and finished in 2nd place in EM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The poor USD performance of the stock market seems odd when we look at the &gt;5% real GDP growth that Turkiye has compounded since 2010. </span><span class="font4">However, the gap between the best-in-CEEMEA real GDP performance and below-average GDP growth in USD is one more lens to see the issues in Tiirkiye’s recent economic performance.</span></p>
