<p><span class="font5">Throughput growth for Chinese ports has likely entered into a lower growth paradigm as global economic growth has slowed while the domestic economy continues to rebalance. With 89% of CP's asset portfolio in terms of throughput in 2015 (and 80% by profit) being from Chinese ports, the company’s operational performance is still greatly leveraged to Chinese trade activity and volume trends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The charts above and below show that the overall growth rate of Chinese port volumes has been decelerating over the past decade with a marked slowdown over the past few quarters. Even though we have seen this growth rate pick up in 2Q16, we do not believe volume growth can revert to the levels seen in the early 2010s, while mid to low single digit growth appears to be a reasonable assumption in the coming few years. However, if volume growth continues to decline faster-than-expected, it would result in potential downside to our assumptions.</span></p>
