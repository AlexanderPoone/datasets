<p><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">adjustment</span><span class="font4"> yet the increases in the seasonally adjusted data were solid. But even discounting the signal to some degree, we think consumers are continuing to spend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The latest job less claims report was another indicator that sent an upbeat signal about the economy, but one that we might want to discount to some degree. Initial claims fell to 187,000 during the week ending January 13 after seasonal adjustment, hitting one of the lowest levels in recent years (Figure 2). The seasonal factors expect some big swings in claims filings during the holiday season and in the early part of each year, so individual weekly prints may not be reliable in isolation. But the broader trend still looks favorable in the data and is suggestive of strength in the labor market.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Manufacturing still sour</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Going in the other direction, the Empire State manufacturing survey surprised significantly to the downside, with results coming in at very downbeat levels. We don’t think there is a sharp break occurring in the manufacturing sector and the separate regional manufacturing data released by the Philadelphia Fed produced weak results, but ones that were much less alarming. Stepping back, the more lagging (but more reliable) manufacturing data from the Fed’s IP report also has shown a soft trend for manufacturing output in recent months, although some bounce back in auto production following strike-related disruptions has helped boost the aggregate readings (Figure 3).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Housing getting a little life</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the few reliable regularities in macroeconomics is the inverse relation—with a few months’ lag—between mortgage rates and housing demand. And so this week’s indicators of homebuying appetite shouldn’t be too surprising in light of the 4Q decline in mortgage rates. This is one of those cases where one should be clear about levels and changes. While lower mortgage rates are spurring a little more turnover we don’t think we’re going back to where we were a few years ago absent a larger move down in mortgage rates. The January homebuilders survey highlights this distinction: while it jumped 7pts it has miles to go before it ever gets back to ’21 levels (Figure 4).</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Back to inflation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">One of the more important data releases next week will December’s figure for core PCE inflation, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge. If we get our 0.22% anticipated monthly increase the year-ago rate will moderate to 3.0%, while both the three- and six-month annualized gains should be near or below 2% (Figure 5). Recent declines in several inflation expectation measures also support the idea that the inflation trend is cooling.</span></p>
