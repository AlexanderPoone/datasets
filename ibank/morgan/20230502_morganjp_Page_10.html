<p><span class="font3">Foreign holdings at low ebb; domestic ownership at new highs</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Foreign ownership of the stock market has fallen sharply in the last the four years from &gt;60% to only 29%. Local ownership versus foreign ownership is a teeter-totter; we could just as easily say local ownership rose from 40% to 71%. We cannot remember a sharper, fester decline in foreign ownership in a stock market that was not removed from a maj or index. Our Index research team estimates roughly 12% of the big caps are held by index trackers; that means active holdings are down from c. 50% to 15% in those four years. The sharp drop in foreign ownership is - no surprise here - matched by sharp foreign outflows with total outflows of $ llbn since ‘20. Should foreign ownership return to 50%, then in flows into Turkiye would be $ 15 -20bn, or more if foreigners bought in at higher prices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We see both push (foreign selling) and pull factors (domestic buying) in this decline. On the foreign selling, we think the longterm underperformance was the key driver of foreign selling. It is worth noting that corporate governance standards remain high and disclosure by the Turkish corporates remain among the best in the region. On the domestic buying side of the teeter-totter, we think the sharp rise in inflation and significant drop in real yields has pushed locals out of bonds into stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The data on foreign bond flows show a similar shape to </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">tie </span><span class="font2">foreign equity data, notably tie consistent outflows in the few years, totaling US$Sbn in outflows since 2020. Foreign ownership of the local, TRY-denominated government bond market is now down to 0.7% having been over 2 0% as late as 2017.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rise in local holdings of equities is easy to understand in the context of high inflation, moderate nominal yields and significantly negative real bond yieldspolicy rates. The series of charts with inflation, nominal yields and real yields and on the following pages show how deeply negative real rates have become. We also note the dichotomy between purely domestic rates like the benchmark government bond yield (12% on the ‘32s) and the rates where offshore investors are more likely to trade like the 10-y ear OIS swap rate (23%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These charts of real yields £?o£odd with a flat line from Jan ‘10 to early ‘22 followed by sharp drop in real yields in the last year or so. Our takeaway is that moving back to “normal” or something like the previous post-GFC norms will be difficult for Turkish markets. If that adjustment implies higher nominal yields, then that could prove a headwind to equity valuations.</span></p>
