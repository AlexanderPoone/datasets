<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Higher taxes to lift consumer gas and electricity prices at the start of the year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect core to be closer to 2.5%oya by the summer</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Eurostat’s final Euro area December HICP print came in line with the flash estimate. Looking at the broad picture, headline inflation increased 0.5%-pt to 2.9%oya and core inflation decline 0.2%-pt to 3.4%oya. The headline inflation increase was entirely driven by energypriceinflation, up4.8%ptsto-6.7%oya.The strong rise in gas and electricity prices through late 2022 lifted inflation and lead to a powerful drag in 2023 which started to fade in December. Food price inflation meanwhile was dow n 0.8%-pt to 6. l%oya, and thus remained on a downward trend. The decline in core inflation finally was skew ed tow ard core goods (dow n 0.4%-pt to 2.5%oya) while services price inflation was flat at4.0%oya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Details were released for the first time today. Regarding the rise in energy price inflation, these details show' that gasprice inflation (+9.2%-pts to -15.5%oya) was the main driver (in particular the German government paid the w'hole gas bill for consumers in December 2022, leading to a drop in gas prices). Electricity price inflation meanw'hile increased by a lesser amount (+1.1%-pts to -13.1%oya) and fuel price inflation increased 4.0%-pts to 1.2%oya. Within food, the inflation decline was skew'ed toward processed food (dow<sup>r</sup>n 1.2%-pt to 5.9%oya), w'ith unprocessed food price inflation up for the second consecutive month (+0.5%-pt to 6.8%oya). Global FAO prices have been on a dow nw ard trend, which should contribute to a further decline in Euro area food price inflation in the coming months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Today’s details are also important to assess inflationary pressures in the core basket. According to the ECB, seasonally adjusted core prices were up 0.23%m/m in December. However, interpreting these data is complicated due to the impactof HICP weight changes (adistortion largely linked topackage ho lidayprices). Using today’s details, we estimate that weight changes lifted prices by 0.1%-pt in December(a smaller distortion than we expected). Thus, clean core prices were up 0.1%m/msa according to our calculation. Getting a precise number is complicated as the German statisticsoffice last year changed the way it records package holiday prices (monthly prices are now less volatile which makes any seasonal adjustment harder) but our overall sense is that inflationaiy pressures were on the wreak side in December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Overall, the fading of core inflationary pressures was significant in recent quarters. During 4Q22-1Q23, our clea n core measure was up 0.44%m/m sa on average. The pace then averaged0.24%m/mduring 2Q23-3Q23 and moveddown toO. 15%m m in 4Q23. The recent readings are thus tunning close to 2% ar, a significant improvement compared to the near-6% ar pace seen early 2023.</span></p>
