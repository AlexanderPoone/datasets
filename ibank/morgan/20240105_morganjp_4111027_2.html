<p><span class="font3">Inflationary pressures and higher inflation expectations amid curreny pressures are likely to keep most Africa Edge central banks hawkish near term while others cut (Figure 1). We project further rate hikes in 1Q24 with rate cuts possible only in 2H24 when inflation cools. Egypt, Nigeria and Zambia are most in need of tighter monetary conditions as global conditions have inhibited foreign capital inflows needed to fund current account deficits. In Nigeria and Egypt, firm monetary policy tightening will need to be accompanied with tighter fiscal policy in a bid to tame money supply, stabilize prices, ease currency pressures and lower inflation. Lower mining receipts and strong growth have kept Zambia’s current account in deficit while adherence of the NIR targets under the IMF programme has limited BoZ’s FX interventions. As such, a weaker currency is likely to keep the BoZ on a tightening path and we project a 50bp hike to the policy rate in February to 11.5%. As BoP position reamins weak (see below), the risk is for more liikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Opportunistic issuance?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Besides easing and potential reserve accumulation in Latam, another implication of the more benign global environment could translate into the ability of some countries, mainly in Africa, to access external markets. For context, tight global financing conditions have left most Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) sovereigns shut out of international capital markets over the last couple of years. This has forced a rapid rise in domestic debt (including central bank financing) and funding from multilateral sources under IMF programs. We have been cautious in our forecasts regarding external bond issuances in Africa Edge countries in 2024, only pencilling in tiny issuances for a handfi.il (such as Egypt). However, the ‘soft landing’ narrative has led to a decline in yields, particularly in some stressed countries (Figure 2). In fact, Kenya and Angola are not far from the 10% market access threshold — we consider that issuance at yields below tliis level could be attractive for some countries. Therefore, if a soft landing gains more strength then Kenya and Nigeria could be the first to come to markets. Kenya would be keen to partly refinance its USS2bn Eurobond maturity due in June 2024, while Nigeria is in dire need on FX liquidity injection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">While SSA might be the main beneficiary from lower US rates, increased external issuance is also possible in the MENA region. Egypt has been able to access international markets through Panda and Samurai bonds in the last year, and it also issued an expensive Sukuk in February. With yields lower, Egypt might opt for some extra issuance in 2024, assuming it comes against the backdrop of a a credible resumption of the IMF programme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the GCC space, Saudi Arabia is without doubt more active in the Eurobond market after issuing USS 16bn in 2023. Our</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">forecast continues to expect a large issuance in 2024 with most of the predicted fiscal deficit, about US$19bn, to be financed externally. Public issuance is also likely to originate from the SWF PIF which issued US$9bn in 2023 and is expected to continue to spend and invest heavily in 2024. We expect Bahrain to issue US$3bn to cover due amortizations and to finance its deficit, but increased issuance is a possibility with favorable markets. Finally, despite our current call for zero gross issuance in 2024 in Oman, lower international yields could be seen as a good occasion to raise some buffers via issuance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More countries face weak BoPs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Our past balance of payments analysis identified two countries as being more exposed than others: Zambia and Uzbekistan. The weakness for both was driven mainly by a negative basic balance and an associated loss of FX reserves. Using the latest data available in Edge (3Q BoP), we can see that more countries slipped into negative basic balance territory (Figure 3). Zambia and Uzbekistan remained exposed (suggesting FX weakness and/or loss of FX reserves), but they are joined by DomRep, Paraguay, Kazakhstan and Ukraine. Azerbaijan has CA surpluses and invests abroad, DomRep has benefitted from loans and remittances to increase FX reserves, Paraguay from portfolio flows, while Ukraine has received significant funding from donors to achieve a large increase in FX reserves. This leaves Kazakhstan and Egypt as exposed, along Zambia and Uzbekistan. In the third quarter, Kazakhstan was forced to sell large amounts of its FX reserves (and FX sales continue in early 2024). For Egypt, BoP data (volatile because of import restrictions) underscores the need for IMF programme and FX adjustment. Another country which stands out with large loss of FX reserves in 3Q is El Salvador, but that was driven by repayments of external debt. Its external position is robust and FX reserves have increased in4Q23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the GCC, CA prints continue to be in firm surplus territory, with Qatar and Bahrain both surprising to the upside. In Qatar the picture looks solid with a wide current account surplus. On the other hand, Bahrain continues to lose reserves despite</span></p>
