<p><span class="font4">We start with Rockwell given that it has what is arguably the most complex set of sales channels. Per the diagram below, most of Rockwell’s sales follow one of three avenues: direct sales to the end user, sales through its distributor partners, or sales to an OEM, which embed the Rockwell product into a machine that is sold to the end user.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sliced another way, Rockwell revenues can be broken out into three major categories: (1) maintenance (“MRO”) revenue, primarily replacement sales tied to factory utilization; (2) direct sales, either through “solutions” (large projects with ROK engineering content) or recumng services; (3) OEM sales to machine builders; and (4) small project spending, where the equipment is sold through the distribution channel but where third-party system integrators typically provide the engineering/design expertise. In total, we estimate that approximately 10-15% of ROK sales are directly linked to projects with a control system integrator. Keep in mind that the slices of the pie representing OEMs and Solutions are also “system integrator” related. Notably, OEMs will many times sell their machines to system integrators for installation at the end user, while ROK’s solutions business is basically an internal system integration organization. In other words, system integrator activity is a “proxy” for 70% of ROK’s sales.</span></p>
