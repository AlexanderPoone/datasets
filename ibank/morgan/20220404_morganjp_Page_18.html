<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Chile: A change in CBC reaction function?</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The CBC Board hiked the policy rate by 150bp, to 7%, in a unanimous decision this week. We had expected a 175bp hike, while the BBG consensus stood at 200bp. While not explicit, the statement suggests a key reason behind this “dovish” hike is the global shock associated with the conflict in Ukraine. The statement also stressed that household consumption already is adjusting. We agree with the CBC’s base case forecast of a contraction in activity. Yet we also note that household consumption remains above its trend, which is consistent with the still-high core inflation the Board recognizes in its report (see </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">note)</span><span class="font5">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The statement does recognize that inflation expectations have moved higher and, most relevant, that expectations for the policy horizon remain well above the 3% target (Figure 1). The Board not only hiked less than what was expected and priced in but also provided somewhat dovish forward guidance. The timing of this message embedded in the policy report may prove risky. If inflation runs higher and/or is more persistent than in the central bank’s baseline forecast, it could further dislodge expectations, eventually forcing the central bank to hike more than it envisions in the forward guidance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, the new administration’s fiscal policy agenda as well as political and institutional uncertainty (see </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">note)</span><span class="font5">, likely will be reflected in a higher inflation risk premium, at least until the uncertainty is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">18</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The central bank reaction function seems to have changed, with more weight on economic activity performance and less on the current state of de-anchored inflation expectations. To be precise, the weight on inflation expectations is still above that of output gap, yet not as high as in prior months. Thus, the central bank likely will continue to tighten monetary conditions via policy rate hikes, though more gradually and by less than what the market had priced in. The forward guidance now shows a ceiling for the policy rate of 8.5% in 2H22 (well below what the market had priced in) and a floor at 6.3% for 4Q22.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In all, the distribution of risks amid the current central bank strategy prompts us to revise higher the terminal policy rate in our modal scenario. We now call for the policy rate to reach 8.5% in 3Q22 (7.75% in 2Q22 before). Importantly, this level would not be consistent with new pension fund withdrawals or additional fiscal accommodation. Such a scenario would merit a higher policy rate. We also revise the policy rate for 2023 and set a new level for 4Q23 at 6.0%, above the corridor ceiling by then.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Colombia: After not speeding up, no way to slow down yet</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BanRep hiked the policy rate 1 OObp to 5% this week, less than the 150bp expected by J.P. Morgan and the consensus. The decision was taken by a 5-2 majority, with two dissenters voting for 150bp. Over the last month, inflation and inflation expectations have risen further, reinforcing both analyst and market expectations for BanRep to accelerate its hiking pace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">statement</span><span class="font5"> was sparse, recognizing the jump of inflation above 8%oya in February, led by food prices (23.2%oya), while core inflation (ex- food/energy) rose rapidly from 2.49% in December to 4.11% in February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">BanRep’s staff raised its 2022 growth forecast to 4.7% from 4.3% in the context of strong January activity and the ongoing recovery in the labor market. The March statement reiterated the Bank’s commitment to gradually return inflation to the 3% target.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Notably absent from the communique was mention of the Fed, which has begun hiking and now is expected to move much more quickly; challenges to policy continuity stemming from the outcome of the presidential elections; and elevated credit risk premia as a result of the political uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the press conference, BanRep reiterated that lOObp hikes are historically large. BanRep also remarked that monetary transmission lags imply that inflation cannot be slowed down quickly. The board also emphasized that the medium-term inflation expectations are still in the target range.</span></p>
