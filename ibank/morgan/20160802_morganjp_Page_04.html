<p><span class="font3">assets such as CIMC (expected to make a loss in 1H16) and the container leasing business seeing a sharp decline in earnings in 1 QI6 (down &gt;70% Y/Y). We further see upside risks to our estimates as our current base case factors in relatively conservative expectations for volume and yield growth while we have not yet quantified the potential positive synergy effects from the COSCO/China Shipping merger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">In order for CP to re-rate higher, we believe the company will need to demonstrate its ability to raise its overall return profile, initially through improved yields at the newly injected assets from CSPD where efficiency gains should be achievable given the undemanding base. Furthermore, the Street has been lowering expectations for the Chinese port sector since 2H15 on the back of the weaker-than-expected volume growth trend since 1Q16, and thus any realization of positive synergies from the COSCO/China Shipping merger (which we believe could start making an impact in FYI 7) would accelerate ROE improvement. Announcements of acquisitions that are at attractive valuations (deviating from recent trend of paying high P/Esfor new assets) may also support the share price higher, in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">How we got here...</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">First listed in 1994, CP's business has transformed substantially over the years. The company first began as a container leasing company under the COSCO Group but throughout the 1990s and 2000s, CP diversified its operations beginning with its first port acquisition (a 50% stake in COSCO-HIT Terminals in Hong Kong) in 1995. Even though the company expanded its operations to other business segments such as logistics and container manufacturing, container leasing and port operations formed the core of CP's operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the late 2000s, CP decided to change course and instead of diversifying its operations, the company looked to sharpen its business focus through divestitures of non-core assets beginning with the disposal of a 20% stake in Chong Hing Bank in 2007. CP continued along this path over the next several years until the company was once again focused on two core lines of business, container leasing and terminal operations, but by the mid 2000s, the ports segment had overtaken container leasing as the company’s largest operating segment.</span></p>
