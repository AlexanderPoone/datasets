<p><span class="font2">PMIs (9/30: China; 10/1: Australia, Japan, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines; 10/2: Sweden, Spain, Switzerland, Italy, France, Germany, Norway, Euro Area, UK, Canada, US, and Colombia; 10/3: Australia, Japan, and Singapore; 10/4: Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, Euro Area, UK, and the US; 10/5: UK and Canada) will headline next week's economic calendar.

Supported by the recent softer trend of core inflation data, European government bond yields continued to push Lower after euro area core inflation came in below consensus. USTs traded in a roundabout manner on quarter-end and accordingly the most volatility in price action came ahead of the 3:00pm ET and 4:00pm ET closes. Ultimately, the curve mildly bull-steepened as rates finished slightly richer, led by the front end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Broad NZD strength and broad CAD weakness stood out in the G10. NZD (+0.6%) gains came ahead of next week's October RBNZ meeting, while CAD (-0.7%) Losses extended after the Canadian registered flat m/m growth in July, with indications for only 0.1% m/m growth in August. The US dollar pared overnight declines in the NY session, although the DXY USD Index’s lack of relationship with rates or equities implied quarter-end dynamics likely drove price action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">US equities finished mixed as a retracement in Energy stocks weighed on the Russell 2000 (-0.51%), while the Nasdaq 100 (+0.08%) eked out a marginal gain. Energy Losses came amid a move Lower in the commodity, as WTI crude oil (-1.00%) futures contracts slid below $91/bbl.
