<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">DomRep: BCRD resumes rate hikes; expect more ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Following the surprising pause in BCRD’s hiking cycle last month, we inferred that the central bank would favor a more gradual policy adjustment, and we tempered our expectations for the magnitude of short-term rate hikes to 25bp. We argued that policy inaction could raise several risks, including losing control of inflation expectations, and, possibly, creating some macro imbalances. Against this backdrop, we argued that gradualism now would likely give rise to the need to be more aggressive in 2H22. Last Friday’s decision to hike 50bp to 5.5% seems to validate our view that faster policy normalization, and eventual tightening, is warranted. BCRD seems to be losing some conviction about the timing and pace of the expected inflation slowdown, pointing out that shocks have become more persistent and that convergence would be “gradual” and would come later than thought before. Inflation will likely remain under pressure at least in the short term. Additionally, we think domestic demand growth momentum will be strong, and we now expect a faster normalization of US policy rates. Against this backdrop, we are adding 50bp of hikes in the year and now expect the year-end rate at 8%. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(S. Palacio)</span></p>
