<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss on the Mar-Q guide due to greater than expected decline in WWG offset by broad based strength in core vertical markets and moderate growth in Datacenter. </span><span class="font3">Xilinx guided Mar-Q revenue to $765M (up 6% Q/Q) and well-below consensus estimate of $827M and original guidance of ~15% Q/Q growth. The miss in guidance is due to greater than expected declines in WWG (Wired and Wireless both down) due to a slowdown in the 5G rollout, the ongoing transition of FPGAs to ASICs for baseband products, and broad-based weakness across the Wired business offset by broad based growth across Xilinx’s different businesses with DCG returning to moderate growth vs. original guidance of strong growth due to a slower ramp with Xilinx’s storage and network customers along with growth in AIT (A&amp;D and ISM are expected to be up as programs for multiple emulation and prototyping customers ramp) and in ABC (auto expected to recover as ADAS demand improves vs. F3Q20). Consumer is expected to be weaker. GM guide of 69.5% was above JPMe/Street estimates of 69.2%/68.4%, respectively, and opex guide was $318M. Implied EPS of $0.81 was below consensus of $0.87 but above JPMe ($0.76).</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FPGAs to ASIC transition has continued in 5G, as expected, but we see attractive long term growth trends in core vertical markets and in Datacenter. </span><span class="font3">While we anticipate the RFSoC wins that Xilinx has won for remote radio head (RRH) platforms will generate strong and sustainable 5G related revenues (more antennas and more compute required), the modem/control/data plane processor functionality on the BBU/Basestation that is currently being run on FPGAs (many from Xilinx) will continue to transition to custom/semi-custom ASIC solutions from Broadcom (ZTE, Nokia, Ericsson), Marvell (Samsung, Nokia), Intel (Ericsson), and HiSilicon (Huawei). Xilinx expects this ASIC transition for the baseband side to wind down by 4Q20 but there is potential for this transition to take longer than originally expected. While we don’t know the mix of RRU to BBU revenue contribution to Xilinx’s 5G revenue mix, the inevitable transition to ASIC solutions will be a drag on growth. Although the inevitable transition from FPGAs to ASICs is occurring for 5G base stations, Xilinx has other parts of its business that are doing well such as its Zynq platform, which continues to gain more adoption from its auto customer such as its Zynq MPSoC powering automated valet parking. Also its strong datacenter wins with hyperscale customers such as Amazon, Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent should provide a strong offset to potential growth headwinds in its 5G business. Recently, Alibaba Cloud announced that Xilinx is powering their data centers, which are being used by Alibaba’s cloud sendees enterprise customers.</span></p></li>
