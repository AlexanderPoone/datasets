<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Company Overview</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical is a leading healthcare company in China with business operations covering most of the important segments in healthcare industry value chain. It is engaged in R&amp;D, manufacture, distribution and retailing of healthcare products, including pharmaceuticals, diagnostic products, and medical devices. Fosun has formed a relatively complete product portfolio in the six major therapeutic areas: cardiovascular system, metabolism and alimentary system, central nervous system, blood system, anti-infection and anti-tumor, which are areas with the greatest potential to grow in China’s pharmaceutical market. In 2015, there were 19 formulation products and series of the group that each recorded revenue of over RMB 100 million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fosun distributes products in the domestic and overseas markets. The company cofounded and owns about 32.1% of Sinopharm, the largest medical product distributor in China. The company has good knack for identifying potential M&amp;A targets. It has made itself into the Top 5 pharmaceutical companies in China by a series of strategic acquisitions and we think will continue to strengthen its position in the future.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Business Segments</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fosun conducts its business primarily through the following three business segments: Pharmaceutical manufacturing and R&amp;D, Healthcare sendees, Manufacturing &amp;&nbsp;Distribution of medical diagnosis and medical devices.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Pharmaceutical manufacturing</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Pharmaceutical manufacturing is the core business of Fosun Pharma’s strategic development. It is one of the top five domestic pharmaceutical companies in China currently, according to IMS. It mainly produces innovative drugs, first-to-market generic drugs and differentiated branded generic drugs for the six largest and fastest growing therapeutic areas in China, i.e., cardiovascular system, metabolism and alimentary system, central nervous system, blood system, anti-infection and antitumor. It has 148 GMP certified production lines in 18 plants in Shanghai, Chongqing, Sichuan, Hebei, Guangxi, Jiangsu and Liaoning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This sector earned revenue of RMB 8,843 million in 2015, representing a Y-O-Y increase of 21.7% and accounted for 70.7% of the group’s revenue in 2015 as compared to 60.9% in 2014. In 1H16, the segment generated revenue worth RMB4,797mn, accounting for 69.7% of the overall revenue and an increase of 17% YoY. This was primarily due to a surprising 48% increase in the revenue from Cardiovascular system drugs portfolio. Other therapeutic areas like anti-infection, central nervous system and anti-tumor increased by 31%, 26% and 22% respectively. This represents that Fosun is becoming more heavily reliant on Pharmaceutical sales. In 2015, the sales of the Group’s major products in therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular system, metabolism and alimentary system, anti-infection and antitumor maintained rapid growth, with sales of anti-malaria medicines in the antiinfection therapeutic areas such as artesunate series increased by approximately 126%.</span></p>
