<p><span class="font7">2023 vs. 2019</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We draw parallels with past upturns and consider risk-reward to be especially attractive now with the consensus downgrade cycle similar to the 2018 trough. Good news is hard to come by near the bottom, and on the balance of probabilities we view that 2023 is the start of a recovery year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Navigating tech cycles - experience required. </span><span class="font1">The tech industry often repeats previous cycles, but they rarely run on schedule, and trying to figure out the exact start and end dates of cycle inflections is unrealistic. But, we should build portfolios that are durable enough against down- and up-cycles with the understanding that they are a natural extension of markets even if we don't know when they will occur. In the current market, we are reminded that cycles often rhyme and by studying what drives an upturn, one can Look for similarities to spot new up cycles. From this, we believe that: (1) it is better to be conservative than generous on valuations; (2) it is better to be cautious than optimistic on earnings; and (3) it is better to be contrarian than unhappy near the bottom when Looking for entry points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Conservative rather than generous on valuation. </span><span class="font1">Putting the current sector correction in the context of previous tech cycle inflections, we are at a very late stage of the down-cycle for market expectations. While it seems reasonable to assume that a lot of bad news has been discounted, with the -45% average correction in tech stocks from the peak and the majority of investors we've spoked to anticipating recession coming in 2023, some simple 'what's in the price' analysis suggests that markets could have Limited downside absent any deterioration in geopolitical news flow. A cyclical downturn would require the tech sector to fall -10% from here to previous troughs and rise 107% to peak. Based on the average earnings reductions for Asian tech stocks of -20% this year vs. our Leading earnings model points to a -16% drop over the coming months, it should be clear that consensus is now erring on the side of a caution' vis-a-vis our top-down base case assumption, which is an upturn driven by YoY improvements from 1Q23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Incrementally less cautious on earnings - what happens next? </span><span class="font1">Exhibit 1 shows the headwinds that we expect now are: (1) further earnings downgrades for Late cycle tech stocks in our coverage, a process that began in 1Q22, as illustrated in Exhibit 8; (2) recent incremental headwinds from bottom-up data points as we move past the 'eye of the storm' (Ice Age - End In Sight) are affecting an already-declining YoY (2023) revenue momentum of -3% in Semis and -2% in Hardware; (3) further corrections in Leading indicators, including falling inflation expectations and ISM/PMI moving toward previous average troughs of 48 by mid- 2023 vs. 50 now; and (4) further normalization of growth expectations, especially in Long duration areas, such as EVs, on which we are incrementally cautious relative to semis on risk-reward.</span></p>
