In all, the distribution of risks amid the current central bank strategy prompts us to raise the terminal policy rate in our modal scenario. We now call for the policy rate to reach 8.5% in 3Q22 (7.75% in 2Q22 before). Importantly, this level would not be consistent with new pension fund withdrawals or additional fiscal accommodation. Such a scenario would merit a higher policy rate. We also revise the policy rate for 2023 and set a new level for 4Q23 at 6.0%, above the corridor ceiling by then. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(D. Pereira/L.

<p><span class="font4">March inflation will print this Tuesday; we have a be low-consensus 0.77%m/m call based in part on evidence that food inflation has (at least temporarily) started to slow and with last month’s VAT-free day lowering goods prices. Our call would lift inflation from 8.01%oya to 8.29% (versus the consensus 8.44%), increasingly above the 3% (+/- lOObp) target, but a level that should be the peak. Last week, BanRep hiked the policy rate lOObp to 5%, below the 150bp expected by J.P. Morgan and analyst consensus. The decision was taken by a 5-2 majority, with two dissenters voting for 150bp. BanRep reiterated its commitment “to take the necessary steps” for a gradual return of inflation to the 3% target, arguing medium-term expectations are still in the target range and that 1 OObp hikes are historically large. However, notably absent from the communique were any mention of a) the Fed or b) challenges to Colombian policy continuity depending on the outcome of the upcoming election. Our concern is that BanRep has underemphasized the expectations channel and that by taking a longer time to get even to a neutral stance in terms of the real policy rate they are opening the door to a quicker deterioration of inflation expectations than the steady pace observed in recent months (notwithstanding our below-consensus call for March CPI). Moreover, we think the Board has eschewed a risk management approach to monetary policy, as in the event that the policies of the current front-runner (Petro) are less gradual and more confrontational than some of his advisors are currently suggesting to the market, then the neutral policy rate could be structurally higher (on credit premium) and a more restrictive stance would be needed to anchor expectations compared to a policy continuity scenario. We now see two more hikes of lOObp, followed by a 50bp in July, taking the rate to 7.5%; this level would be restrictive in a continuity scenario but would be insufficient if the post-election outlook looks more adverse. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(B.

<p><span class="font4">Impacted by higher food and gasoline prices, Lima headline inflation accelerated in March, printing +1.48%m/m (JPM forecast: 1%) and driving annual CPI to 6.82%oya, 382bp above the BCRP inflation target ceiling. When adjusting for seasonality, headline inflation gained +0.8%m/m, sa, driving the 3m/3m saar pace to 5.2%. A well-behaved exchange rate and the lack of underlying growth momentum is behind core prices running lower, at a 2.7% 3m/3m saar pace, which gives the central bank the flexibility to continue tightening monetary conditions without additional de-anchoring of inflation expectations. Following March’s CPI report, we revised end 2022 headline inflation higher by 20bp, to 5.0%, expecting an acceleration to 7.6% average in 2Q22, decelerating to 5.5% in 4Q22.
