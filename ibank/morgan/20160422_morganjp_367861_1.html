<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Factory visit notes and good vibes from rival's performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Techtronic Industries (TTI) is one of the largest producers of branded power tools and floor care products in China with sales mainly in the US and Europe. We visited TTI’s largest production base located in Dongguan, Southern China. The key takeaways are that the large production base (consolidated from 9 locations over the past 5 years) is still the most reliable and efficient location to produce power tools despite wages which have soared in recent years. The recent quarterly announcement from rival Stanley Black &amp;&nbsp;Decker (SWK US; N; covered by Michael Rehaut) showed continued strong demand for power tools which should also benefit TTI. TTI trades at a CY16 PE of 16- 17x and we estimate 16-19 EPS CAGR of 19%. The shares are up 3% over the past 3 months (Hang Seng up 14% over this period).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">SWK 2Q results encouraging</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">SWK reported its 2Q16 results on 21 April before trading and the shares outperformed the S&amp;P500 by 4% on 21 April. We see continued sales growth in its tools and storage division of 4.6% Y/Y (+8% ex. FX) above our -2%E. The stronger-than-expected sales were due to strong demand in pretty much all geographies. As TTI has historically achieved sales growth at a much faster (5-10% faster) rate than SWK (tools and storage) in the past few years, we are comfortable with our approx. 10% increase in sales for FY16 for TTI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The EBIT margin of 15.3% for SWK’s tools and storage business for 2QFY16 is down 0.40 percent Y/Y but the decline is mostly due to FX. We note that TTI has less non-USD sales than SWK and relatively more RMB cost than SWK so the negative impact of a strong USD on TTI’s margins should be lower than for SWK. Nevertheless SWK’s 15.3% EBIT margin for 2QFY16 is still significantly higher than our FY16 8.8% EBIT margin for TTI, leaving room for long term upside in margins for TTI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Please see: Stanley Black &amp;&nbsp;Decker - </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">IQ EPS Above Our Est.. St. and Guidance; 2016 Op. EPS Guidance Raised -AL ERF</span><span class="font5"> by Michael Rehaut, CFA on 21 April formore details</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Description of Dongguan site</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TTI’s main production facility is located in Dongguan, Southern China and we believe that over 80% of total TTI sales (tools and floor care) is either produced at this location or subcontracted to third parties nearby for final assembly or packaging in this location. The site land area is over 3m square feet and ideally situated in an area with many component suppliers (like motors and PCBs) and subcontractors (for older mature products not made in-house).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Research and development focus</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since the beginning of 2008, the staff level has dropped from 18k to 14.5k today through efficiency gains and other automation efforts. However, the number of R&amp;D staff (excluding testing of existing products) has doubled over this period to about 950. In 2015, TTI constructed a new R&amp;D building to consolidate its China R&amp;D in one place at this Dongguan site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Plenty of room for expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">TTI has consolidated all of its production in China from 9 locations into one enormous 3m square feet plant (land area) of which only a little more than half is used up. As such, TTI could probably increase capacity at this facility to handle the next 6 to 7 years of growth without the need for a new site or add land to existing site. The large size and concentration of production in one place gives TTI an advantage in terms of economies of scale and speed to market over some other peers with less control over its production or in-house research.</span></p>
