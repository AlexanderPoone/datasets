<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Top Picks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We continue to highlight RUN and NOVA as top picks, as the residential solar sector remains relatively immune to supply chain headwinds and significant mcreases in utility retail power rates provide installers an ability to increase pncmg while still offering customers a value-add. We continue to highlight ARRY as a top pick within the utility-scale solar space, as a higher nsk/higher reward idea with improved visibility into margin recovery to result in a positive stock re-rating. We also highlight SHLS as a top pick within utility-scale solar. Although near-term results will likely be impacted by broader project delays, we view SHLS as a category leader with best-in-class margins, which should position the stock to rebound faster than its peers once visibility into utility-scale project timing improves.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>4Q results takeaways</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4Q demand trends remained favorable with most product/solution companies reporting record bookings and/or backlog figures. </span><span class="font5">The strength was broad-based with residential solar companies (ENPH, GNRC, SEDG, NOVA, RUN, SPWR), utility-scale solar (FSLR), storage (FLNC), biomass (EVA), smart meters (ITRI), and fuel cells (BE) all reporting record bookings and/or backlog. Wind blade manufacturer TPIC was one standout that did not report record demand. ARRY, CSIQ, FCEL, and SHLS have not yet reported results.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Increased BNEF global solar forecast</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bloomberg New Energy Finance published its IQ Global PV Outlook report last week. </span><span class="font5">BNEF estimates that 184 GWs of PV solar were deployed in 2021, up 27% Y/Y. Notably, BNEF increased its FY22 estimate of PV deployments to 245 GW, up 33% y/y, revised higher from a prior forecast of 24% y/y growth. Also, BNEF increased its 2030 target owing to its view that energy security is gaming political support. BNEF targets 3.9 terawatts (TW) of cumulative global mstallations by 2030, up from -1.0 TW today, though still below the estimated 5.3 TW required by the end of the decade to be on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Increased near-term targets. </span><span class="font5">BNEF increased its FY22 estimate of PV deployments to 245 GW, up 33% y/y, revised higher from a prior forecast of 24% y/y growth. Owing to continued shipping headwinds and elevated raw material pricing, potentially exacerbated by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, BNEF expects solar prices to remain elevated during FY22, despite supply rampmg during 2H22. The largest increases in the forecast compared to the 4Q outlook were driven by China, Germany, and Brazil.</span></p>
