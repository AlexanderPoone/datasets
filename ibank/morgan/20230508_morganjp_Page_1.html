<p><span class="font4">The Constitutional Council is to be dominated by the right</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">The election of the Constitutional Council members, one of the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">three bodies created to write a new Constitution for Chile,</span><span class="font6"> has roughly replicated the results from last September when rejection won in a landslide.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">The rightist Republicans have become the most voted political party tonight, with more than 35% of the valid votes. This is despite the fact Republicans was one of the parties with parliamentary' representation that did not adhere to the Agreement for Chile, which enabled a second constitutional process after the Rej ection victory back in September. In fact, the victory allows the right-of-the-centre party to enjoy 22 seats out of 51 in total, thus 2/5s. That makes the Republicans the most relevant force in the Council, given its veto power, as norms require 3/5s to be approved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Meanwhile, the center-rightgot a bitm ore than 21 % of votes, which allows the pact to have 11 Council members. Thus, the sum of the center-right and the right parties are to enjoy more than the 3/5s majority, which allows them complete control of the process, as they could approve norms without the need to reach agreements with the ruling party or the center-left, as they require 30 votes to be approved. The control of the right, if well managed, could allow the country,' to move forward with a minimalist constitution, which would be capex positive in our view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Of note, the pendulum behavior of Chilean voters observed in the last five years also should prove a warning signal in the sense of the institutional need to settle the constitutional debate and allow medium and long term uncertainty to ebb. As observed in Figure 1, an index of economic policy uncertainty showed a regime break back in 2019, when the political system was shocked by social unrest, and opened the possibility to rewrite the constitution. Since then, economic uncertainty has not regained the low range that had characterized the country' for decades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Finally, the results come as another political defeat to President’s Boric coalition, supported by 28.5% of the votes and thus 17 Council members. The fact that the opposition is to dominate the Council compounds the recent defeat in the House when the tax reform was rejected, and raises the question of whether the leftist coalition will choose to moderate further so to reach agreements in Congress, or become defensive at the cost of accepting a legislative logjam and perpetuate uncertainty ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">While political strategies ahead could offer surprises, our central scenario assum es the institutional design of the new constitution process is to help offer a m inim alist new constitution so to gain enough popular support in December and be approved. That said, given the results today, the tax and pension reforms discussion in Congress are likely to go for longer, possibly well into next year.</span></p>
