<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lower for much of the session until a possible more-sustained escalation in geopolitical tensions in the Middle East aided in the intraday reversal. Global equities traded poorly, weighed down by subdued economic data from China and the sharp adjustment higher in discount rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">China equities (Hang Seng: -3.71%) kicked off the Wednesday session with sharp weakness after a chorus of disappointing economic data in China. Quarterly GDP growth softened, with notable weakness in industrial production, while home prices registered the largest decline since 2015. Our economists view the size of reactive easing (Rmbltrn of special bond issuance) as insufficient to reverse the fiscal austerity. Weak sentiment around China weighed on the Antipodean currencies, AUD (-0.5%) and NZD (-0.4%), which lagged G10 peers all G10 peers except JPY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An upside surprise in UK CPI ahead of the London open assured there would be no reprieve for risk assets at the start of the London session. Strong core CPI at 5.1% y/ y in December (C: 4.9%) induced a sharp bear-flattening of the UK gilt curve as market participants reduced this year's implied BoE rate cuts; SFIZ3Z4 steepened by 27bp, to -113bp. Declines in UK equities (FTSE100: -1.48%) exceeded those of European peers (SX5E: -0.98%), whilst the largest rise in 10y gilt yields (+18.8bp) since February 2023 boosted GBP (+0.3%) even against a generally stronger US dollar (DXY USD Index: +0.0%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pronounced sell-off in UK gilts weighed on both US and European duration. Front-end losses across Europe were sustained amid comments from ECB President Lagarde, who acknowledged it is likely the ECB will cut rates in the summer but stressed the aggressive pricing of rate cuts are not &quot;helping our fight against inflation, if the anticipation is such that they are way too high compared with what's likely to happen.&quot; Amid this market participants pushed out the pricing of the first full 25bp ECB rate cut to June from April. In the sell-off across the European government bond complex, peripheral spreads widened as 10y BTPs underperformed 10y Bunds by 3bp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Impacted by the move in cross-market rates, USTs entered the NY session distinctly cheaper with the curve flatter. Moves would then become more pronounced alongside the 8:30am ET release of robust December US retail sales. This reignited the duration sell-off and the UST curve now bear-flattened as the long end turned lower for the session. The Atlanta Fed's Latest estimate of 4Q23 real GDP growth was revised up to 2.41% q/q (P: 2.2%). Amid this, short-term interest rate markets reduced the odds for a full 25bp rate cut by the Fed in March to near 50%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the underperformance of the 20y on the 10s20s30s butterfly near the middle of the 40-50bp range, where it has spent most of the past year, the $13bn 20y UST re-opening auction produced a small tail. The auction stopped-out at 4.423%, a 0.8bp tail, although auction internals underwhelmed. A drop in the allotment to indirect bidders to 62.2% (P: 66.4%) and an unchanged allotment to direct bidders of 20.5% (P: 20.7%) Left primary dealers with 17.3% (P: 12.9%), their highest allotment since November 2021.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">US equities fared better than global peers after a rally in the Last 30 minutes of trading brought the S&amp;P 500 (-0.56%) well off session lows. Rate-sensitive stocks from a credit perspective (Russell 2000: -0.73%) still Lagged broader equities, as the</span></p>
