<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">US Fixed Income Overview</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Yield rise and HG spread tightening likely reaching limit</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasury yields continued higherand the curve steepened on the backof stronger-than-expected economic data and somewhat hawkish Fedspeak while HG credit spreads narrowed further to near their post-GFC tights as demand has outstripped supply. We think it is now appropriate to add duration in the belly while we turn bearish on credit spreads and remain neutral on mortgage spreads</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We review monthly TIC data for November. Foreign investors bought $131bn longterm securities across US fixed income products, with foreign private investors adding $167bn while the foreign official sector sold $36bn Purchases were concentrated in Treasuries and corporates and largely emenated from the Euro area and the UK</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economics: Retail sales rose 0.6% in December, with the control group rising 0.8%, providing an upside risk to our 2.0% real GDPgrowth forecast for 4Q223. Initial claims filings fell to their lowest levels in over a year</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Treasuries: We recommend adding 5-year duration longs: yields are back to early Decemberl eve Is, TIPS breakevens look rich, and positioning appears neutral. Long-end pairs remain too flat to their drivers, though the mispricing is now smaller hold 5s/30s steepeeners, as well as 2s/5s flatteners. TIPS breakevens have moved to their widest levels since early November and appear substantially rich versus fair value, likely driven in part by technical factors. Initiate energy-hedged 10-year breakeven narrowers</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest Rate Derivatives: We maintain our widening bias on intermediate swap spreads and remain long gamma</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seen ritized Products: Mortgages spreads widened on the week but are now looking fair given the money manager, Fed, and bank demand profile. In mortgage credit, we prefer non-QM A2s over CRT M2s. Despite the optimistic tone at the CRECF conference, we think the recentoutperformance in CMBS spreads is likely overdone and turn cautious</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Corporates: HG bond spreads are currently very close to post GFC tights, held down by continued very strong technicals. That said, wefeel valuationsare sufficiently expensive to justify a more bearish stance at this juncture</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">Since our last publication a fortnight ago, long-end Treasury yields have continued to rise and mortgage spreads widen on the back of stronger-than-expected domestic economic data, pressure from DM rate moves, rising inflation expectations, and somewhat hawkish Fedspeak. Meanwhile HG exceptionalism extended into the new year with credit spreads tightening further despite heavy corporate issuance as demand remains robust. At these levels, we think it is appropriate to add duration in the belly while we recommend fading the richness inintermedia te breakevens. Concun ently we remain neutral on mortgages but hold a more bearish view on HG credit and CMBS spreads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Turning first to the data, retail sales rose by a strong 0.6% in December, with the important control group rising 0.8%, and even with these numbers buoyed by favorable seasonal factors, the unadjusted data is still supportive of a healthy household sector. Indeed we think real consumption rose around 2.5% saar in 4Q23, adding upside risk to our 2.0% real GDP</span></p>
