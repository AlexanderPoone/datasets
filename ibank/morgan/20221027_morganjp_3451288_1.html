<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Delta-hedged, Vega-neutral 3M USD/CAD call spreads delivered a smooth performance over the past two years, and are currently attractive given the wide skew/vol ratio on CAD.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elevated carry-to-vol ratios and flat curves are generally supportive of the implementation of long EMFX plays via long-dated options. As the EM team remains generally cautious on EMFX, we consider low-premium trades that bank on the supportive technicals, such as JPY/INR puts and EUR/PLN puts.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Delta-hedged USD/CAD call spreads as a way for fading elevated skew</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Ahead of Wed we were concerned that BoC would potential aggressively hike above neutral in the face of a slowing economy. The delivered 50bps hike alleviates that risk to a degree. With the market now entertaining 50bps for the Fed Dec hike, the pace of slowing on both sides seems to be in sync, though that equilibrium may get upset if indeed it turns out that the inflation cooling gets quicker underway in CA than the US.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Since hitting 1.39 a few weeks ago, USD/CAD spot drift higher has halted and reversed, largely on the back of the pause/wobble in the broad USD performance. Against such a backdrop, even the less aggressive BoC than expected is not able to revive the earlier trend higher, judged on the post-BoC price action. If the top-side momentum indeed has already faltered, the USD/CAD skew pricing should not be near 10-y high (ex-COVID period) - Exhibit 1.</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<p><span class="font5">While the USD/CAD spot dynamics and the anticipated skew underperformance anchor on either USD losing its mojo or CA and US central banks moving at a similar pace, the historical backtest (Exhibit 2) indicates that the performance backdrop may not be as dire even if the USD resumes some topside momentum. Historical performance suggests vega neutral delta-hedged 2M to 3M expiry USD/CAD call spreads to be able to weather the drawdowns well (most notably the March-April and late summer drawdowns). A less aggressive notionals sizing brings in too much of the noisy gamma (ATM strike) performance, while more aggressive notionals sizing on the short OTM call leg has been suboptimal YTD amid the predominantly punchy spot-vol corr. Realized spot-vol corr is running -3Opts above the implied SABR based spot-vol corr, but that spread should be taken with a grain of salt with the rolling window trailing measure of the realized spot-vol corr being backward looking.</span></p>
