<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">COSCO Pacific </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Overweight; Price Target: HK$ 10.00)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">CP has been proactive in its efforts to narrow its business focus in recent years including two key divestments of non-core businesses: disposal of CP's logistics business in 2009 and container manufacturing segment in 2013. However, over the last couple of years, we believe CP's share price has been discounted given the prior dual-segment focus of port operations and container leasing, the latter of which has been struggling in the current operating environment that has seen overcapacity from the shipping liners and falling raw material prices result in lower rental yields as well as second hand box prices with pressures unlikely to ease substantially in the near-term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence, we believe the recentrestructuring will translate into more stable core earnings growth (Adj. EBITDA CAGR of 7% from 2016-18) as well as FCF profile (FCF yield projected at 9-10% by FYI 8) as terminals offer more steady growth (2010-15 CAGR of+14% vs -3% for container leasing), which could potentially help CP unlock some value (prior to restructuring, CP was trading at 0.6x P/B, substantially lower than peers like CMHI which was at closer to lx P/B).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Dec-16 PT of HK$10 is based on our DCF valuation. Our PT implies an EV/EBITDA of 10.5x, and P/BV of 0.8x on FY16E.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; For consolidated ports: </span><span class="font4">WACC of 8.1%, terminal growth of 1%, and debt to capital of 25%;</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">For non-consolidated associates and JCEs: </span><span class="font4">we used a cost of equity of</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">9.5% and terminal growth of 1%</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Key downside risks to our PT include: tariff cuts, weaker-than-expected volume growth, execution risk with new port investments, and adverse currency movements against the USS which will have a negative impact on yields.</span></p>
