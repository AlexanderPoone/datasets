<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank loans came in above expectations again, increasing 1.81 trillion yuan in February, with the annual growth rate ticking up to 11.6%oya. Details in the bank loan data highlight ongoing strength in medium and long term loans to the corporate sector, reflecting the impact ofgrowth-supportive credit policy, including credit support for developers to stabilize the housing market. Besides, government bond issuance and corporate bond issuance both picked up in February. Overall, it seems the credit backdrop was broadly supportive of the key components of fixed investment (solid manufacturing and infrastructure FAI growth, as well as moderation in the sequential slowdown of real estate FAI) early this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, household loans remained on the soft side, likely dragged by early mortgage repayments, while housing market activity appears to be in the process of bottoming out.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the monetary policy font, our forecast expects an other 1 Obp policy rate cut in April. L owcr-than -expected CPI infl at ion seem s to work again st th c PB OC 's institutional bias to keep policy rates unchanged. We also look for two 25bp RRR cuts (in 2Q and 4Q respectively). Looking ahead, the PBOC has started to issue guidance to rein in excessive credit extension, and we expect March credit growth to decelerate. Overall, we expect 2023 TSF growth to come in stronger than our previous forecast, and we have revised up our full-year TSF growth forecast to 9.8%oya.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The PBOC released its credit report for February, with both the TSF data and bank loans coming in above expectations. Regarding aggregate credit conditions, TSF increased 3.16 trillion yuan in February (JPM: 2.38 trillion yuan; consensus: 2.30 trillion yuan). The stock of outstanding TSF grew at 9.9%oya (vs. 9.4%oya in January). Bank loans also beat expectations, increasing 1.810 trillion yuan in February (JPM: 1.485 trillion yuan; consensus: 1.50 trillion yuan), with the stock of outstanding loans rising 11.6%oya (vs. 11.3%oya in January). Regarding nonloan components of TSF, government bond issuance picked up to 814 billion yuan (vs.414billionyuan in January), corporate bond issuancerose364billionyuan(vs. 149 billion yuan in January), and the shadow credit components (trust loan, entrust loan and bank acceptance) contracted modestly by 8 billion yuan (vs. expansion of 349 billion yuan in January).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Regarding monetary aggregates, M2 money supply growth picked up to 12.9%oya in Febmary (vs. 12.6%oya in January), translating to sequential growth of 1.0% m/m sa (vs. 1.6% m/m sa in January).

In addition, yuan deposit increased 12.4%oya in Febmary (unchanged from 12.4%oya in January), and the ratio of annual increase in new loan to increase in new deposit came in at 77.6% (vs. 75.7% in January).</span></p>
