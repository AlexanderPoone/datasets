<p><span class="font4">We project the US and China to decelerate this quarter, slowing global growth to a trend-like pace. Signs of decelerating US activity can be seen in retail spending and hours worked, both of which stalled following a surge at the start of the year. But with the notable exception of the recent rise in jobless claims (up more than 10% from their 4Q22 average) there is little in the data pointing to outright weakness ahead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In contrast to the fear of momentum loss, the April DM flash all-industry output PMI rose for the fourth consecutive month and now stands at its highest level in a year. Gains were broad-based across the G4, with services leading the way. The benefits of a still strong US service sector, amid mixed signals from April industry surveys, should also be evident in next week’s March PCE report (April 28), where we anticipate a 0.3%m m real gain in the face of declining retail sales. Serv ice- sec tor strength, supported by a turn upward in government spending, should also be reflected in the upcoming April employment report (May 5). Manufacturing signals are more mixed. A recovery in global output gains is underway, led by China. But a return to growth is not yet seen in the regional survey data or Asian export indicators. With drags related to inventories and the tech sec tor persisting, it will take time fora broad rebound to take hold. For now, the rise in the orders to inventory ratio in this week’s flash PMI is modestly encouraging, and we anticipate a significant slowing in the pace of stockbuilding, amid accelerating final sales growth in next week’s US 1Q23 GDP report.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Banking sector stress poses a material downside risk. We maintain our view that the credit tightening will be significant but build slowly, and the effectiveness of Fed liquidity measures in arresting stress and the limited spillovers to other financial markets support this view. Adjusted for breaks it is encouraging to see continued gains in banking loans through mid-April. From the perspective of our recession probability scenarios, this news combines with positive growth momentum to temper our already low probability of a near-term recession (Figure 3). With near-term recession risks fading, the probability increases that central banks end up “boiling the frog” as they continue to lean against persistent inflation. We expect the Fed to take comfort from financial market</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">developments and tighten 25bp at its next meeting. Key to our expectation of a midyear pause is the mix of concerns raised by recent stress, interacting with evidence of US growth moderation, and building uncertainties related to the looming US debt ceiling deadline. However, absent recession or an unexpected moderation in inflation, we think the Fed will maintain a hawkish bias and the market underestimates the risk that a midyear pause may not represent the terminal rate for the cycle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">China’s IQ GDP came in notably above expectations, jumping 11.9%q/q, saar in our estimate. A range of factors have driven the strong recovery in activity:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reopening. </span><span class="font4">The reopening impulse is driving a surge in consumer spending that reduced the household saving rate 5.4%-pts on the quarter (implying a 23%ar surge in real spending last quarter above and beyond income gains).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government support. </span><span class="font4">China has also benefited from a front-loading in policy supports that in IQ helped lift high-tech manufacturing investment 15.2%oya, solar battery production by 53.2%oya, and new energy car production by 22.5%oya.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing finds its floor. </span><span class="font4">Policy actions have also tempered the housing market correction. While real estate investment continues to be a drag, the decline moderated to 5.9%oya in March, with earlier-than-expected bottoming of housing activity (residential home sales value rose 8.8%oya in March) and recent signs of recovery in new home prices.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Global demand. </span><span class="font4">The export sector has delivered a notable upside surprise, as total exports grew significantly in Marell, benefiting from near-term resilience of global demand and strong rebound of supply-chain activity in China.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">We expect the reopening bounce to continue into 2Q and look for GDP to expand a solid 6.3%q q, saar. The upside is clearest for the consumer, as travel and tourism still have much ground to recover, especially going into the Labor Day holiday. For spending to continue, however, a stronger recoveiy in disposable income, which has lagged the recoveiy, will be necessary as another large decline in the saving rate is less likely. Perhaps the least appreciated source of upside is private sector investment, which remains lackluster.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">China’s 1Q23 GDP outturn shows consumption and net exports driving the expansion even as investment has lagged. In regional spillovers, the impulse is further fragmented into tech versus non-tech, with tech shipments to China stabilizing</span></p>
