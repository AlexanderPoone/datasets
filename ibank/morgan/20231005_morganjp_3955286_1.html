<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ongoing sell-off in bond markets has seen Global Agg yields rise to new post-financial crisis highs of 4.3%. This in turn has prompted questions in our conversations over valuations in bond yields as well as over how high term premia are.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning first to valuations, we revisit our longer-term fair value framework for real 1 Oy UST yields (see </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">A fair value model for US Bonds, Credit and Equities</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">. </span><span class="font6">Panigirtzoglou and Loeys, Jun 200 5 and more recently in ROZ.. Jun24<sup>th</sup> 2023). The model values the lOy real yield as a function of the real Fed funds rate, inflation vol as a proxy for term premia, and three major components of net demand for dollar capital: government, corporate and emerging markets. We measure these as the government deficit, the corporate financing gap (the difference between capex and corporate cash flow), and the EM current account balance, all as a % of US GDP. In the EM current account surplus, we include from the IMF WEO data on EM, as well as other DM economies. In principle, higher deficits by governments and corporates ought to exert upward pressure on yields as overall demand for capital rises, while higher external surpluses of EM countries ought to push US yields lower due to repayments of dollar-denominated debt and/or dollar asset accumulation by their central banks. We note, however, that beyond the EM current account balance, the model does not incorporate other international factors.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the model captures the effect of central bank balance sheet policy in two ways. The first isa flow effect, where wesubtraetthe Fed’s netpurchases of government and agency debt securities from the overall government deficit. And the second is a stock effect, measured by the ratio of excess reserves divided by the stock of government and agency securities held outside the Fed.</span></p></li></ul>
