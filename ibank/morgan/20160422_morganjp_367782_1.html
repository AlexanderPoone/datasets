<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What's new?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> China Eastern Air Holding Company (CEAH), parent company of China Eastern Airlines, and Ctrip announced a strategic collaboration agreement </span><span class="font5">under which CEAH and Ctrip (covered by Vivian Hao) will collaborate with each other on a broad range of products and services such as low-cost transportation solutions, international air travel, IT technology, travel insurance, and E-commerce. Further, in connection with the agreement, Ctrip has agreed to invest Rmb3B in CEA’s A shares through a private placement of shares. Ctrip may also increase its stake in CEA in the next twelve months following the private share placement and may also be entitled to appoint an Observer or a Director to CEA’s Board subject to ownership threshold conditions </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(source: company reports and Bloomberg).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ctrip is expected to subscribe to 466MM A shares at a floor price of Rmb6.44 per share, a 3% discount to CEA A share’s closing share price </span><span class="font5">on 20<sup>th</sup> April 2016 prior to its shares trading suspension for a c3% stake in CEA, according to Bloomberg. The total transaction value is Rmb3B (c.HK$3,593MM). CEAH’s stake in CEA will fall to 51% from 62% currently following the new share issuance to Ctrip and 2,329MM new A share issuance by CEA which is underway. Based on the above, we think these valuations seem fair. The transaction implies 2016E 0.9x P/B, 8.4x P/E and 6.8x Adjusted EV/EBITDAR post money. Recall that Delta Air Lines also acquired a 3.55% stake in China Eastern Airlines by subscribing to 466MM new H shares of CEA last year for HK$3,489MM. CEA plans to use the funds for its future aircraft purchases.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Impact on CEA?</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> This new strategic partnership is likely to bring an end to the conflict between CEA and Qunar: </span><span class="font5">CEA was among several airlines (including Air China, China Southern Airlines) who announced the termination of their relationship with online travel agency Qunar (which is integrating with Ctrip) due to their customers' frequent complaints. The conflict was also driven by Chinese airlines’ efforts to increase the proportion of direct sales to cut commissions costs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some trade-oil? This tie-up could, however, cap CEA’s target to continue to increase its proportion of direct sales and reduce its reliance on travel agencies. </span><span class="font5">Recall CEA has optimized its online sales platform (i.e. website and mobile applications) and streamlined its online overseas payment systems. In 2015, CEA’s direct sales revenue rose to 37% of its total sales, rising 66% y/y and it targets to raise this to c50%. CEA’s 100%-owned low cost carrier China United Airlines also launched its brand-new optimized official website and mobile-app last year which helped to increase its proportion of direct sales to 47% of total, resulting in sales commissions cost savings of Rmb 120MM in 2015.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect this strategic partnership to be broadly positive but the impact is unlikely to be significant near term: </span><span class="font5">Recall China Eastern Airlines did not manage to gain sufficient shareholder approval previously when Singapore Airlines and Lentor Investments (which was wholly owned by Temasek Holdings) had planned a proposed strategic investment in China Eastern Airlines back in November 2007. Bringing in strategic partners with much smaller equity stakes such as Ctrip (through its dominant market position in air ticketing and hotel accommodation bookings) and Delta Air Lines (through joint sales and slot coordination) can help cement the cooperation agreement and feed more domestic and international leisure and premium traffic into China Eastern’s network by leveraging on Ctrip’s and Delta Air Lines’ expertise and distribution without compromising much management control.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay OW: </span><span class="font5">We believe CEA has the best geographical hub location which should benefit from Shanghai’s Free Trade Zone and Disneyland with sufficient airport capacity enabling the airline to expand its operations. Its fleet simplification</span></p></li></ul>
