<p><span class="font5">flash DM October services PMI, hints that last quarter’s growth and inflation dynamic may be promoting a constructive rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A key risk to this narrative is that C0VID has more permanently damaged the supply side of the global economy and that growth constraints will persist. With global shipping costs still elevated and the October flash PMIs showing DM delivery times lengthening further, manufacturing bottlenecks look to have remained intense despite the sharp slowing in final goods demand last quarter. Perhaps more concerning are the hints of a permanent hit to global labor supply. The fall in labor force participation has yet to reverse and could indicate a slower recovery than we expect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Relative supply shortfalls threaten central banks’ ability to pave the way for complete recoveries. That the Bank of England is now poised to begin normalizing rates next month is partly due to its assessment that labor markets are tightening rapidly even as furlough programs have ended. The Fed, meanwhile, remains committed to a full recovery in US labor markets before rate normalization starts. Although employment remains more than five million below its pre-crisis levels, unemployment is up less than two million as a result of a substantial reduction in labor force participation. The Fed’s patient rate guidance is built on expectations that fading COVID drags will generate a strong supply response that boosts jobs while alleviating labor market mismatches that are intensifying wage pressures. In the face of job gain disappointments, a dramatic 1.1%-pt drop in the US unemployment rate in the last three months (to 4.8%) is an important warning that supply side constraints may not prove as transitory as we and the Fed anticipate.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>China’s 3Q data hit the skids...</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">September activity data reinforced China’s disappointing 3Q21 GDP report. On the heels of last week’s news of slowing credit growth, IP plunged while real estate investment fell for the first time since the pandemic began. A second consecutive monthly rise in exports was a positive while the retail sales rebound reversed only part of a sharp August drop. To get our 4Q growth rebound both policy and the data will need to turn fairly quickly. An easing of energy shortages should allow IP to reverse a good chunk of September’s drop in October, while consumer spending and services activity should continue their recoveries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This key risk relates to the tension between easing macroeconomic and tightening industrial policies. While we expect additional fiscal support through government bond issuance and rising spending, we no longer look for PBOC RRR cuts</span></p>

<div>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>...but some signs of a turn elsewhere</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While China remains a source of concern there are encouraging signs elsewhere. Mobility continues to trend up globally and recent US alt data have firmed notably. The October DM flash composite PMIs also moved higher. Within the report, services led the move higher, while manufacturing struggles with signs of continued supply constraints as delivery times lengthened still further and output prices rose again (Figure 3). EM trade data hint at some easing of bottlenecks with Taiwan’s September export orders and Korea’s 20-day October export data showing strength. Balanced against these hints of a pickup, our global nowcaster continues to track a more modest 3.2%ar pace this quarter, well below our 4.8%ar forecast.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>BoE to hike as other DM central banks hold</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Markets pulled forward the expected start to rate hikes across the DM this week, but in most cases we think these central bankswill remain patient. The main exception is the UK, where we meaningfully shifted our view on the BoE this week: we now look for liftoff in November and additional rate hikes in February and August next year, as well as the end of the BoE’s reinvestment program. The Fed remains on track to announce its taper plans in November, but Chair Powell stressed patience on rates in remarks this week even as markets now see the Fed hiking twice next year. The RBA has pushed back harder: late this week it met market pressure on rates by resuming YCC purchases for the first time since Februaiy. The RBA’s minutes this week reiterated its guidance to keep rates on hold well past market pricing for hikes to start in 2022, noting that several quarters of inflation sustainably within the 2%-3% target range are needed to consider rate hikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Three DM central banks meet next week, and we expect all to retain their low-for-long guidance. The BoC is likely to scale</span></p>
