<p><span class="font5">Much of the growth in consumer spending on goods over the past year has been in motor vehicles. And that development has likely owed to the improvement in the inventory situation and ultimately the recovery in auto and light truck production. Excluding motor vehicles, manufacturing production has been gradually trending downward since 1Q22, a trend that continued in June (Figure 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Lately the regional manufacturing surveys haven’t been especially reliable guides to where factory output is heading. That said, the early factory surveys released this week from the New York and Philly Feds together suggest manufacturing activity will remain sluggish in the near term.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>A small step back for housing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The June housing reports released this week generally came in a little on the light side. The number of housing units started last month slipped 8.0% to an annual rate of 1.434 million units. Even after a downward revision the number of starts in May jumped 15.7%, so some payback was warranted (Figure 4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Meanwhile, June existing home sales slipped 3.3% to an annual sales rate of 4.16 million. After peaking at a sales rate of 6.56 million in early 2021, home resales slid to a 4.0 million rate this January. After popping higher in February, existing home sales have since sunk back close to the cycle lows.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>The week ahead</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In addition to the already-mentioned first look at IQ GDP, the big event of next week will be the FOMC’s decision on Wednesday. We believe the outcome should be straightforward. We expect a 25bp hike (taking the target range to 5.25%-5.5%), as generally hinted at by various Fed speakers over the intermeeting period. Since there are no new dots set to be released, the only other 2pm development next Wednesday is the post-meeting statement. There we expect only cosmetic changes, and most importantly no change to the forward guidance about “determining the extent of additional policy firming that may be appropriate.” While some of the doves might prefer to wait and watch, we don’t expect any dissents. In the post-meeting press conference, we look for Powell to indicate that the June dots are still informative, but that no decisions about the future have been made and policy will remain data dependent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The curious outcome of the June FOMC meeting—no hike but dots revised up to show a strong majority for at least two hikes over the remaining four meetings of the year—already made a hike at the July meeting seem likely. The data over the intermeeting period hasn’t been that surprising. While the June CPI was certainly welcome it will probably take a few more favorable outturns to influence the FOMC’s thinking. Fed speakers generally haven’t been explicit about the July decision, but there’s been little said to push back against markets confidently expecting a hike next week.</span></p>
