<p><span class="font2">Last supply push: November was the second largest month for sovereign issuance this year, after January. Issuance reached US$132.4bn YTD, 89.8% of our total issuance expectations for this year. This compares to US$61.8bn having been issued at this point last year. Potential issuers in the coming weeks include Abu Dhabi, China, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Mexico in the IG space and Serbia in the HY space.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">HY positioning and cash balances increase: Cash balances at the end of October indicated a reduced risk appetite, increasing on both a weighted-average and simpleaverage basis. Amid this, funds increased exposure to HY names again, with the largest increase in exposure to names rated CCC and below (+0.48pp), and only marginally higher exposure to names rated BB and B (+O.O7pp and +0.04pp, respectively). Exposure to names rated both A and above and BBB was reduced (-O.52pp and -O.76pp), respectively. Notably, on a single-name basis, fund exposure increased the most to Venezuela, mostly driven by price, and is now the third most OW name (+O.35pp to 0.86% OW). A more detailed analysis on positioning using a broader sample space suggests that 1/3 of funds have no exposure to Venezuela and another 40% are UW the name (see: Venezuela Debt: A Refresher).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Flows to become a more Important support in 2024: This year, high amortizations and relatively low issuance became key technical supports for the asset class amid record fund outflows. Next year, amortizations are set to come down, while supply is likely to Look similar to that seen this year amid continued fiscal weakness. This will make fund flows more important supports. The first step to see renewed inflows is for investors to get comfortable with duration, which we think will happen toward the end of 1Q/early 2Q24. This would benefit EM by being part of the global bond universe. The second step is whether EM can actively attract inflows in excess of its global share. This Likely takes even Longer as growth picks up further versus DM, financial conditions ease further, and the amount of defaults in the index falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ETFs now also starting to register outflows: EM debt-dedicated flows have improved materially over the past four weeks, with US$3.6 billion in outflows being registered. This contrasts to the US$9.2 billion in outflows in the prior weeks. On the hard currency side, sovereign funds fared better than mixed sovereign/corporate and corporate-only funds, while on the Local side, regional/country funds played a bigger role, in particular due to outflows out of the Chinese Local bond market. Week-on-week flows have been relatively volatile, especially on the hard currency side, where the pace of the core rate rally has been a key driver. With 10y UST yields now only 2O-25bp off of our 2Q24 target, the market will need more conviction on eventual cuts for flows recovery to continue, in our view. ESG funds saw Larger outflows over the past four weeks, driven by hard currency ESG funds.</span></p>
