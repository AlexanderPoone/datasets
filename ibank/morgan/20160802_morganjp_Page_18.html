<p><span class="font4">As CP looks to accelerate its overseas acquisition program, the company’s asset portfolio will continue to grow with likely expanding geographical coverage. As a result, the company's ability to operate ports in different jurisdictions will be paramount to its success. Furthermore, CP would have to effectively control for differing risks across various jurisdictions, which could pose a challenge if the stability of domestic economies and governments becomes an issue. So far, it appears that CP has been able to export its operational expertise from China to foreign terminal assets while demonstrating the ability to manage these operations effectively as demonstrated by the company's track record so far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Nonetheless, this is a key risk not only for future acquisitions, but for legacy assets as well. Hence we believe that additional cooperation with CMHI would allow the company to better hedge/control for this risk both on the operational side (given CMHFs successful track record in Africa and South Asia) but also during the project selection phase.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Negative driver #3: adverse FX movements and falling yields</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite most of the company’s assets being located in China, the company reports in USS (a result of the company's original container leasing focus whereby revenue and profits were primarily in USD/HKS) and thus adverse currency movements against the USS (such as the recent Rmb depreciation trend which has seen the Rmb fall c5% against the dollar during 1H16) would affect CPs effective yield. Furthermore, as the company expands its overseas presence, exposure to non-USS currencies (such as the EUR. at PCT) will likely rise. Hence, if local functional currencies weaken substantially against the dollar, it would also have a negative impact on CP's profits.</span></p>
