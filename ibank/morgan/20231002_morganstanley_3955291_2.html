<p><span class="font6">Met coal: All about supply</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Met coal prices have jumped a Large 38% since August, to $333/t, the highest since March. Met coal demand has undoubtedly been a support to the price, with China's stronger steel output and skew towards blast furnaces, as well as India's weaker monsoon season supporting stronger demand during the normally soft Q3 (see Met Coal Rising). However, we would also note that although China's coking coal imports are up a Large 61% YTD, around 85% of this now comes from Mongolia and Russia (whose combined imports are up 97% YTD), meaning there is Less of an impact on the seaborne market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In our view, supply disruptions have been the key price driver, and how these play out from here will determine the path going forward. Australia (&gt;50% of seaborne market) has seen Queensland coal shipments Lag, down 7% vs the 2018-22 average in recent weeks, driven first by strikes and maintenance and more recently by a temporary suspension of truck operations at BMA's Peak Downs mine, with no restart time yet given. China's domestic supply has been tightening too, as a number of fatal accidents at coal mines has driven shutdowns at both mines and wash plants. In Guizhou, a city-wide halt has been put in place, affecting 93% of coking coal capacity or 49 mtpa (Bloomberg), while Shaanxi province will conduct safety checks at smaller mines over Golden week, with mines in poor condition threatened with immediate shutdown (Bloomberg). McCloskey also notes that the Mongolia border at Ganqimaodu will be shut over Golden week - Mongolia has accounted for 60% of China's met coal imports in recent months. In Indonesia, where coal output is up 13% YTD, risks are rising too, as uncertainty Looms around output quotas for miners. According to McCloskey, some miners will soon have to halt operations unless given more quota. A new online approval system (E-RKAB) is Launching this month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Where next? </span><span class="font2">We see met coal well supported on elevated supply disruptions against a backdrop of strong demand. However, with China steel mill margins under pressure, finding further upside may be challenging. Some Lower grade coal may also find support for blending, as steel mills Look to cushion margins. Going into Q1, the usual seasonal weakness in shipments may be more muted as EL Nino is typically associated with drier weather in Eastern Australia, particularly favouring production and exports in Queensland, as seen in 2019/2020. MSe $280/t1Q24 with risk-reward skewed to the upside given recent rally.</span></p>
