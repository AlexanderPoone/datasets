<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question is whether the move lower in bond yields is over for the time being, and can it resume further down the line without a clear bout of activity' weakness materializing? We called last October to position for the rollover in bond yields - see “</span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">Enter long duration trade</span><span class="font8">”, but have at the start of this year argued that tactically there is likely to be a consolidation in the down move in bond yields- see </span><span class="font8" style="text-decoration:underline;">January Chartbook</span><span class="font8">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fall inbond yields from October highs was sharp, with the US 10-yearyield down lOObp in 3 months to current levels, and down 120bp to recent lows. Central banks rate projections have already moved substantially, now pricing in a cumulative 150-170bp of cuts by the Fed and ECB over the next 12 months, and markets digested a raft of benign inflationprints, which resulted in a move lower in inflation forwards.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big picture, we believe that long duration call will stay relevant for 2024, but one is likely to see a pause first, and technically there is even a risk that bond yields bounce, on the exhaustion in negative convexity impact, on potentially more longer dated government bond issuance, and along with likely some more mixed inflation prints ahead. In our view, we are u »likely to see another leg lower in bond yields nearterm u nless or u util there is a cleardeterioration in activity dataflow. OurUS Fixed Income team has 3.95% end QI projection for 10-year, flat from here, and 3.65% for end year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, what could be the implications for equity markets of tliis? Clearly, in November and December equities took the fall in bond yields as an overwhelming positive, fueling a risk-on market rebound. BKX was up 30%, Cyclicals outperformed Defensives, with the exception of Real Estate and Utilities, both of which held up better. However, the typical defensive bond proxies, such as Healthcare and Staples, significantly lagged. Small caps beat large caps during those 2 months, reflecting their high beta nature, but the question is whether small caps will be able to work as well if the overall market is not having a clear bid higher.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not think bond yields will be down from current levels in the near term, which likely stalls the rally, and crucially we do not expect that the decidedly one sided interpretation of why bond yields have fallen, will continue. This is especially ifwe do see so me weakening in consumer, services and labour market dataflow, all three of which were solid to date. We note that there was a big fall in the latest employment component of US services ISM, which could be an ominous sign - see middle chart.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put together; as yields fell in Q4, beta rallied, with market internals diverging further from activity levels - bottom chart - investors fully embraced the Goldilocks narrative. If that setup changes, then Defensive names could have a catchup, especially as their valuations vs Cyclicals are now attractive. We note that Healthcare, Telecoms and Staples have started the year on a stronger note in both the US and in Europe, and we expect this to continue -we are OW Healthcare, Utilities, Telecoms, Real Estate and Staples.</span></p></li></ul>
