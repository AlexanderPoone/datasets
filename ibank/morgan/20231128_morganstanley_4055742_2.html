<p><span class="font2">The timing is what interests us more than the absolute Levels. During 2022 there was a continued healthy level of additions both in number and valuation being added to the global unicorn count. However, since January 2023 there have been fewer than 1 new unicorns on average being minted on a 90 day rolling basis. This has in fact dropped to zero in November after the initial enthusiasm for venture-backed Al funding rounds has somewhat eased from 2Q/3Q23.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The largest dollar reason for unicorns leaving the group is due to IPO activity. The average size of unicorns leaving this cohort of companies via public Listings was $11bn. By comparison, more companies Left via SPACs (24 vs 19 via IPO). However, the average company going public via SPAC versus IPO was one tenth of the size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even if not the Largest reason in dollar terms, the most frequent reason for companies Leaving the unicorn grouping over the past 2 years has been (1) Acquisitions - amounting to 52 companies and $136bn of value acquired; (2) Dehorned unicorns - which effectively means the companies fell off the radar of most market watchers and IPO pipeline speculators. 47 unicorns representing $15Obn of value fell below the ever-critical $1bn valuation mark when they needed to go back to investors for further primary capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With IPOs and SPACs having all but stopped in recent months, the share of larger private companies Losing their unicorn status either via acquisition or simply falling below the necessary valuation threshold has been increasing exponentially in recent</span></p>
