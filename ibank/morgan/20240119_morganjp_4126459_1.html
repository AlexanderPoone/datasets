<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain swap spread wideners in intermediate maturities. QT taper expectations, a rise in SOFR towards IOR, strong AOCI gains for banks, emerging Fed speak that appears to lower the odds of near-term Basel III endgame implementation, as well as valuations remain favorable. We recommend asset swapping original issue 10s that are on the verge of falling under the 5Y maturity window ...</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swap yield curve, carry and slide remain the name of the game as the Fed continues to lean against expectationsofpremature easingand forwards appearlikely to “roll up” with the passage of time ...</span></p></li>

<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bond basis once again in the limelight thanks to somewhat higher long end yields and a steeper 10s 20s curve. Thus far the USH4 contract has seen no CTD shifts, but numerous near-CTD issues exist and the CTD could indeed shift to the 4.75% Feb ‘41 in a modest selloff. However given a net basis that is only slightly wider than the current CTD(the 4.5% Aug ‘39), the impactonUSH4pricing would likely be modest. That said, more material CTD shifts are certainly a possibility if yields rise by larger amounts or iftliecurve continues to steepen. Investors concerned about CTD ex tension can mitigate this risk by buying March USH4 118 puts</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain a long volatility bias - recent declines have been undoubtedly painful, but elevated policy uncertainty, lower market depth, and a decoupling from fair value all point to higher implieds going forward</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overweight gamma on 2Y tails versus 5Y tails as an attractive core position going into eventual Fed easing, that is additionally supported by relative value considerations</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overweight 2Yx2Y swaption volatility versus 5Yx5Y as a way to benefit from relative value mispricings while also positioning for a rise in the expiry curve towards fair value</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank earnings revealed strong AOCI gains across banks, handily exceeding our projections and suggesting that we had erred in overestimating the extent to which banks derisked securities portfolios after the punishing selloff in 3Q23. We discuss a revised framework forprojecting AOCI changes with a much better out-of-sample performance for4Q23, which we think should better explain aggregate AOCI changes going forward</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font5">A lot has happened in the two weeks since our last publication. While much of the country has grappled with multiple cold fronts, markets appear to be heating up fairly early in the year. Economic data (CPI, retail sales, jobless claims) have come in strong, and bank earnings season has kicked off, with banks posting strong AOCI gains thanks to the decline in yields in 4Q23. The past two weeks were also heavy on Fedspeak, which continues to lean against premature rate cuts but supports QT taper expectations, and also suggests that the odds of Basel III Endgame implementation in the nearterm are nowlower(Figu rel). Policy rate expectations effectively round-tripped over the past two weeks, with markets pricing</span></p>
