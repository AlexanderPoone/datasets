<p><span class="font2">now even as the performance gap with growth narrows and see quality and defensive stocks emerging as the key drivers for Japanese equities as the market shifts focus to the U.S. economic slowdown in 2024.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stronger yen is positive in this cycle: Not only do we not view yen appreciation as a threat to Japanese equity indices this time around, we think moderate yen appreciation could even be a positive. While external demand stocks will see a negative impact in the form of a shaip reduction in weak-yen benefits, domestic-demand stocks and consumers will see a positive impact. The positive impact on consumers is particularly important in that it will boost demand at domestically oriented companies and facilitate Japan’s deflation exit. The forward curve is pricing in ¥141/$ at end-2024 versus a Bloomberg consensusof¥136/$ and our ¥146/$ forecast (Figure 4), but evenassuming the consensus here implies a negative EPS impact of just -2% for TOPIX and -4% for external-demand stocks. In addition, assuming no hedging, a stronger yen would boost overseas investors’ final dollar-denominated returns (+8% impact on 2024 dollar-denominated returns at end-2024 rate of ¥136/$).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maintain preference for domestic demand stocks despite weak wages and consu mption: We see investment in consumer spending-related sectors as one of the key investment themes for 2024 (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">report</span><span class="font2">). Our recent meetings with North American investors (Nov 13-17) showed them concerned about Japan’s deflation exit possibly stalling in view of negative GDP growth in Jul-Sep, weak personal consumption, and an ongoing decline in real wages (Figure 5), but we expect wages to get support from the minimum wage increase (+4.5%) that went into effect on Oct 1 and a likely increase in winter bonuses on the back of strong Jul-Sep earnings. Dai-ichi Life and others have followed Suntoiy’slead in announcing plans to increase wages in 2024 (Figure 7), and we believe Japan is currently in a transitional period to a positive turnaround in real wages.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;External-demand stocks await a turnaround in semiconductors and FA: Externaldemand stocks face headwinds around prospects for modest yen appreciation and a decline in U.S. demand. The autos sectorwas exceptionally strong in Jul-Sep, but we see its advantage gradually receding as catch-up production peaks out and the yen reverses direction. As we indicated in our Oct </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">report</span><span class="font2">, we think any emerging prospects for a full-fledged recovery in semiconductors and early-cycle machinery sectors such as FA could have them becoming the key drivers in external-demand and cyclical sectors (Figures 8, 9). Semiconductors are a strategic business supported by the government from the perspective of economic security (¥2 trillionin government support set for FY2 024), and the FA sector will benefit from the growing corporate need for automation and labor-saving. We think this has both sectors poised forpro fit recovery and renewed investment.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North American long-only investor's still underweight?: Our recent meetings with North American investors (Nov 13-17) showed that long-only investors remain underweight in Japanese equities, and our impression is that many plan to increase their positions going forward. Japanese institutional investors are meanwhile finally shifting from neutral to overweight (Figure 10). Historical data shows thatthe to tai global position in Japanese equities is still underweight (Figure 11). In addition to the buying power of foreign investors, we also note potential fora significant increase in the investment power of individual investors as interest rates rise, as well as strong investor interest in the buying power of corporate pension funds for Japanese equities (</span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">report</span><span class="font2">).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Declining support for Kishida cabinet a concern: Against this backdrop, the fact that the Kishida administration’s approval rating has fallen to the 20% range is cause for concern (Figure 13). Because a pro longed drop below 30% approval, which is critical for the administration's sustainability, risks putting the brakes on a variety of policies, the political situation will likely be unpredictable between now and the LDP presidential election in September 2024. Even so, we would expect certain of PM Kishida’s policies to continue even with a change in government—including overcoming deflation, expanding corporate capex, and reforming corporate governance.</span></p>
