<p><span class="font4">Sales in May were disappointing</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Thanks to a low base last year, top 100 developers’ aggregate sales in May still managed to see a positive 3% Y/Y growth (</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">fig. 1</span><span class="font7">). However, </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">if compared to the 4-year average, sales were down 45% (worse than -27% in April). </span><span class="font7">In other words, the strong sales in February and March were very short-lived, and the sales level is now back to where we were in 2H22 when sales were typically 40-50% below 4-year average. As the base will get higher in June (pent-up demand from lockdowns was released in June 2022), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we believe the Y/Y growth will turn negative again. </span><span class="font7">Against this backdrop (together with weak macro data like PMI), we reiterate our view that the sector will stay weak and underperform MSCI China until signs of sales recovery or major easing. To buy on dips, we like SOEs as, although their sales are also slowing down, their sales in May are still roughly similar to the 4-year average with market share gains. We prefer </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CR Land. COLL Poly PS. COPH &amp;&nbsp;CR Mixc. </span><span class="font7">We stay cautious on all distressed names </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">(e.g. Sunac China, Sunac Services, Shi mao Services).</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developers’ sales weakened in May: </span><span class="font7">Despite a low base effect due to lockdowns in May 2022, the marginal 3% y/y improvement in May is much weaker than the 31% and 32% y/y growth in March and April, respectively. Compared to the 4-year average, sales were further down by 45% (similar to 2H22). For June, while we expect some M/M growth as developers usually push for more launches in June (June is in fact the month with the highest sales contribution - </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Table 2</span><span class="font7">). we believe the Y/Y growth will turn negative in June as the base is higher (pent-up demand from lockdowns was released back then).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Introducing seasonality-adjusted (s.a.) Y/Y data </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">(fig. 2</span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">): </span><span class="font7">Sales data in 2022 was severely disrupted by lockdowns. Therefore, during lockdowns (e.g. April &amp;&nbsp;May), the Y/Y base would be particularly low, while for the short period after lockdowns (e.g. June), the base would be unusually high due to the release of pent-up demand. To smooth out the impact, we adjust the monthly base in 2022 by multiplying the average monthly sales contribution in 2016-2021 (</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">Table 2</span><span class="font7">) with the full-year sales in 2022, as an alternative way to gauge the sales trend. Using the seasonality-adjusted figures, the top 100 developers’ sales were down by 14% in May, which is worse than what the non-seasonality adjusted y/y growth suggests.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SOEs continued to lead: </span><span class="font7">SOEs saw an average 30% y/y growth in May (nondistressed POEs -23% y/y; distressed names -42% y/y). Compared to the 4-year average, SOEs’ sales still managed to hold up with a +2% growth (nondistressed POEs -51%; distressed POEs -75% - </span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">fig. 5</span><span class="font7">). Only SOEs and defensive names saw a positive y/y growth in May (</span><span class="font7" style="text-decoration:underline;">fig. 8</span><span class="font7">). with </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">China Merchants Shekou </span><span class="font7">(+67%) seeing the strongest sales growth, followed by </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">C&amp;D </span><span class="font7">(60%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Jinmao </span><span class="font7">(58%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">CR Land </span><span class="font7">(55%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Yuexiu </span><span class="font7">(49%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Greentown </span><span class="font7">(23%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">COLI </span><span class="font7">(11%), </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Longfor </span><span class="font7">(9%). </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Poly </span><span class="font7">(5%) and </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Vanke </span><span class="font7">(1%).</span></p></li></ul>
