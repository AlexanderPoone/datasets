<p><span class="font3">Softer 4Q after a boomy 3Q</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we mentioned above, BEA’s second estimate for 3Q growth came out at an even stronger 5.2% saar, with a modest upward revision to real domestic final sales growth despite some downward revision to real consumer spending. Real consumer spending in 3Q was trimmed from 4.0% to a still solid 3.6%saar. The BEA’s report also included the preliminary estimate of corporate profits for 3Q, which was up about 14% saar in 3Q. We think that the strong profits data for 3Q bode well for the durability of the expansion, although profits were still down 0.7%oya, and as mentioned above, we think that growth will step down noticeably in 4Q.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Despite the strong GDP growth in 3Q, and solid corporate profits, real GDI was much less robust, rising just 1.5%saar that quarter (Figure 2). Some of the measurement issues that were affecting the discrepancy between GDP and GDI had been addressed with the BEA revisions earlier, but the current level of the statistical discrepancy is still one of the highest since 1947. Research shows that GDP and GDI converge in the long-iun with successive revisions and we do not have any reason to think this may not happen this time. Hence, as argued above, we think the gross domestic output—the average of GDP and GDI—might be giving a more accurate signal at the moment, which is up 1.4%oya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">As we have been arguing for a while, we do not think the solid GDP growth perfonnance of 3Q is sustainable and we expect a clear slowing in growth in 4Q. This week we had early signals of such slowing in the form of weaker-than-ex-pected data on trade and inventories along with declines in new and pending existing home sales in August. There was a modest rise in consumer spending in October, with real spending up 0.2% in the month; this was a small beat relative to expectations (Figure 3) but a step down from the average in the prior three months. It is early in terms of tracking 4Q figures, but we think real consumption could be up about 2.5% saar or so that quarter. The October construction report also beat expectations, both with a 0.6% monthly increase for the latest month as well as net upward revisions to earlier fig</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ures. Incorporating all this early data on 4Q, we now see some downside risk to our 2.0% real GDP growth forecast for the quarter. The slowing in 4Q growth relative to the strong third quarter looks to be happening across many of the main underlying GDP components. Inventories alone could be a big swing factor for growth between these quarters, with the change in inventories boosting 3Q GDP growth by 1.4%-pts but likely subtracting more than a half of a percentage point in 4Q.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More labor market news next week</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The one main piece of information on the labor market we have seen this week did not reveal much. Initial claims increased from 211,000 to 218,000 during the week ending November 25. Filings have bounced around lately, alternating weekly increases and decreases since late in October, but through this noise the levels generally have been low and are indicative of labor market strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">We will get more news on the labor market starting with the job openings data on Tuesday and culminating with the November jobs reporton Friday. We think nonfarm employment increased 150,000, with the end of UAW and SAG-AF-TRA strikes adding a total of about 40,000 workers back into the count of employment. We also look for an unchanged unemployment rate in November (at 3.9%) and a 0.3% move up in average hourly earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Besides the employment reports, we will get some survey data next week in addition to a revised reading on trade for October and updated 3Q data on productivity and unit labor costs.</span></p>
