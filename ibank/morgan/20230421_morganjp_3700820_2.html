<p><span class="font4">The Philadelphia Fed’s manufacturing survey has been less volatile, but generally disappointing with negative readings since last September. The April headline index continued this trend, declining from -23.2 to -31.1. But the details of the survey were more encouraging: the forward-looking new orders measures improved a bit from -28.2 in March to -22.7 in April. Similarly, the shipments and employment indexes improved somewhat to -7.3 and -0.2, respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Prior to this week’s April releases, the overall trend across the manufacturing surveys has indicated a steady softening since around mid-2021. We think manufacturing activity will likely soften a bit more given the cumulative effect of the policy tightening here and abroad, but it will be interesting to see how the April ISM surveys shape up.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Some concern should claims climb further</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Initial claims for unemployment benefits increased from 23 9,000 to 245,000 during the week ending April 15, coming out close to our expectations. Initial claims filings have been fairly low and range-bound in a historical context, but since the beginning of the year there is a slight discernible Wend upwards, especially following the recent updates to the seasonal adjustment factors for this series (Figure 4). Continuing claims, meanwhile, rose from 1.804mn to 1.865mn during the week ending April 8, also staying at low levels by broad historical standards. Outside of claims, signs of softening in the labor market appear a bit more tentative, and certainly not broad-based at this time. But claims remain the place to look for a potential early sign of a more noteworthy softening of the labor market—and liistoiy suggests a modest but sustained move higher from here could be cause for more concern about the health of the labor market and the broader economy.</span></p>
