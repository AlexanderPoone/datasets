<p><span class="font5">Investors are asking questions about 144As recently: </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">Expiration of Rule 15c2-l1 Relief May Require Rule 144A Issuers to Publicly Disseminate Financial Statements</span><span class="font5">. Pre-crisis, 144A for life securities accounted for </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">5% or less </span><span class="font5">of the JPMorgan Domestic High-Yield index and </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">no more than 14% of high-yield bond issuance in a given year </span><span class="font5">(13.3% in 2007, vs. 4.5% and 4.0% in 2005/06’). Since 2009, the attribution of 144A for life securities as a percenta.ge of issuance has steadily </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">risen in each of the past 14 years, and thus the weighting of outstanding has risen to levels more than 14x the height pre-crisis. </span><span class="font5">More specifically, </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">144A for life securities account for 88.1% of US HY issuance in 2022, </span><span class="font5">which compares to &lt;85.&lt;8%, 76.3% 75.8%, 70.3%, 67.9%, 53.7%, 50.9%, 46.5%, 41.9%, 29.1%, 28.9%, 25.8%, and 14.9% of total HY issuance in the thirteen years preceding. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And the weighting of 144A for life securities as a percentage of US HY outstanding has steadily increased to 68.5%, from 41.5% in 2018,17.2% in 2011 and from 8.6% in 2009. Interestingly if one calculates the YTW for 144A-for-Life securities vs all other outstanding there is a large discount evident. </span><span class="font5">However, this can be explained by considerable erosion in quality as defined by ratings for those securities that are 144A-for-Life securities. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">For example, only 37.5% of 144A-for-Life Securities are Upper Tier (Split BBB, BB) whereas 15.2% are Lower-tier rated (Split B, CCC, NR), vs. considerably more benign statistics for those that are non-144A for life securities (78.6% Upper-tier, 3.1% Lower-Tier). </span><span class="font5">This obviously leads to a higher yield for the component of 144A-for-Life securities in the investable universe. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Noticeably, this is despite the 144A-for-life component carrying a considerable higher percentage of senior secured bonds (34.1% 144A-for-Life Secured vs 7.4% non-144A-for Life). </span><span class="font5">From an industry^ perspective, the largest % of 144A-for-Life securities is in the Energy (10.8%) and Gaming Lodging and Leisure (10.6%). Automotive has one of the lowest percentages of 144A-for-Life securities vs. non-144A (18%) whereas Diversified Media has the most (94%). Lastly, what does trading activity look like in 144As? 144As accounted for 53% of trading activity on a typical day in 2022, which has increased from 29% in 2014, and 39% in 2019. This is below the percentage of outstanding 144As represent. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In other words, 144A-for-life securities do not appear to experience any less trading activity than registered securities.</span></p>
