<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Central Bank Monitor</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">We think the Fed. ECB, and BoE remain on hold through 1H2b. BoJ is expected remove YCC and NIRP in January 2O2b. The EM central banks in Asia are mixed: PBoC lowered the RRR, while there were tightening moves by the Bl and Philippines Central Bank. In Latin America, the BCB and BCCh eased, while Banxico and BanRep held their policy rates steady.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Fed left the policy rate in a range of 5.25-5.50% on November 2. They referenced tight financial conditions, amongst other factors, as a reason to hold, with the full effects of monetary policy and tight financial conditions had yet to filter into the economy. Since the meeting, financial conditions have softened, notably on the back of downside surprises in recent non-farm payrolls and CPI. Our US team continues to see a soft landing for the economy, and expects the policy rate to be on hold into 2024, before the first 25bp cut in June 2024.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Similarly, the ECB left policy rates on hold at 4.0% in their Last meeting and is forecast to remain on hold as they grapple with a slowing economy. In the previous meeting, no announcement was made on PEPP, and we expect forward guidance on PEPP investments to be adjusted in Jan-24, with tapering starting in April-24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The BoE kept Bank Rate on hold at their last meeting, Leaving rates at 5.25%. Recent inflation data in the UK affirms our call for a cutting cycle to begin in 2Q24 after inflation is sustainably below 4% at the core Level. We expect active sales to end once the cutting cycle starts, although passive roll-off remains in place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Last BoJ meeting saw a change in the flexibility of the conduct of YCC -1% became a reference rather than ceiling. The shift further affirms our earlier call to bring forward the expected timing to simultaneously remove the NIRP and YCC in January 2024 (with risk to December). Subsequent to the BoJ meeting, the government framed a fiscal package that should further support the inflation outlook in Japan. While our team now expects the BoJ to raise the short-term policy rate from -0.1% to 0%, we only forecast a hike to Leave zero interest rate policy in 3Q24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The RBA hiked the cash rate by 25bps to 4.35% at its November meeting, its first hike since June. This was in Line with consensus and market pricing, which had moved sharply towards our view of a hike in recent weeks after a run of strong data. Throughout the pauses we have consistently flagged the Likelihood that the RBA would need to restart tightening, and we still think it is unlikely the RBA's tightening cycle is done, and we see a final hike to 4.60% in February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Riksbank remained on hold in a close call, with forward guidance for another data-dependent move. The Norges Bank remained on hold as well, re-affirming its guidance for a 25bp hike come December, while also explicitly noting the chance of a hold should inflation display downward momentum. We believe the Riksbank has reached its terminal rate at 4.0%, but see a hike in December by the Norges Bank. The BoC continues to hold the policy rate at 5.00%, and we see the BoC on hold with a tightening bias for an extended period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Over the course of 2024-25, China will aim to reflate its economy, which we expect will be</span></p>
