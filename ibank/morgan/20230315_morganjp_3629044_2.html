<p><span class="font3">The Jan-Feb data points at a stronger-than-expected recovery. Consumption and services, investment and trade all beat expectations, jointly driven by post-reopening recovery, near-term resilience in DM economy and front-loaded macro policy support.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Recovery in consumption and sendees was remarkable, starting with the Lunar New Year, based on high-frequency tracking along with normalization in individual mobility. NBS reported tliatservice output index rose5.5%oya in Jan-Feb, compared to a decline of0.8%oya in December. IT sendees and financial sendees maintained solid growth (9.3%oya and 7.6%oya, respectively), while dining and accommodation jumped 11.6%oya.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Consumption recovery seems somewhat divergent. Excluding auto sales, retail sales of consumer goods rose 5.0%oya in Jan-Feb, compared to -2.6%oya in December. Not surprisingly, consumption strength was led by catering (9.2%oya), medicine (19.3%oya), petrol sales (10.9%oya), and consumer staples (grain oil food: 9.0%oya). The weak spots were auto sales(-9.4%oya) and telecommunications products (-8.2%oya). The positive news was that auto sales picked up strongly in February after a large decline in January: CAAM auto wholesale(in unitterms) rose 13.5%oya in February aftera 35%oya decline in January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the investment front, the divergent performance between manufacturing and infra-FAI (8.1%oyaand 9.0%oya, respectively) and realestate investment(-5.7%oya)has notchanged, but it is encouraging that the decline in real estate investment has narrowed (vs. -16.4%oya in 4Q22). </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">High-frequency tracking indicators</span><span class="font3"> showed that housing transaction started on the weak side in January but recovered in February.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A cautious reading from the Jan-Feb data is the unemployment rate. The survey-based unemployment rate rose marginally to 5.6% (vs. 5.5% in December). The unemployment rate for youth group (aged 16-24) rose again to 18.1% (vs. 16.7% in December). Although unemployment rate tends to be a lagging indicator in the process of economic recovery, it raises concerns about the income outlook and the sustainability of economic recoveiy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In addition, private investment remains on the soft side, rising 0.8%oya in the first two months of the year. The divergent performance between public and private investment (10.1% vs. 0.9% in 2022) has continued. It is not surprising for public investment to take a lead in counter-cyclical policy implementation, but a sustainable recoveiy will critically depend on the pick-up in private investment. Restoring the confidence among private entrepreneurs is important.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Upward revision for current quarter GDP growth</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Overall, the Jan-Feb economic activity data reinforced the upside risk to our current quarter growth forecast, as we have stated in recent weeks based on high-frequency tracking. We raise the current quarter growth forecast to 9.0%q/q saar (previously: 7.0%q q saar), and the growth in the next three quarters to 6.4%q q saar. 5.5% and 5.5%, respectively (previously: 7.4%/5.5%/6.1 % q q saar). Our full-year growth forecast is now 5.8%y/y (previously: 5.6%).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The revision in the quarterly profile in our growth forecasts reflects an earlier and faster recovery, which is also related to front-loading of macro policy support. As we have explained, </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">our work assumption</span><span class="font3"> is stable monetary policy and modestly contractionary fiscal policy in 2023. In practice, fiscal and credit policy support came in strongly in the first two months of the year. The issuance of special local government bond amounted to 827 billion yuan (compared to 878 billion yuan in the same period last year), suggesting front-loaded fiscal support for infra-FAI activity (similar to the practice last year). Total social financing increased 9.76 trillion yuan in Jan-Feb, a new record high. Based on our work assumption of 9.8% TSF growth for the whole year, the Jan-Feb TSF will accountfor 29% of full-yearTSF </span><span class="font0">2</span></p>
