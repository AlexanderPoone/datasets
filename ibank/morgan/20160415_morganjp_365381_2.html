<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Policy adjustment started to take effect</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Overall, the IQ GDP report was positive. Despite the slowdown in IQ growth to 6.0%q/q saar, the monthly data pointed at a notable pickup in economic activity in March. In particular, industrial production and investment activity (led by infrastructure and real estate investment) improved significantly, with automobile, real estate, cement and steel sectors all recovering to various degrees. In addition, nominal GDP growth improved from 6% in 4Q15 to 7.2% in IQ 16, which implied that the GDP deflator turned from negative (-0.8% in 4Q15) to positive (0.5% in 1Q16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The improvement in economic activity appears to be policy driven.

In addition, new investment projects started, jumping 40% in IQ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Policy adjustment, both on fiscal and monetary front, has been noticeable in the past 2-3 quarters. On the fiscal front, high fiscal spending within the budget, improvement in land sale revenues for local governments since December, and other fiscal policy adjustments such as policy bank lending and increase in local government debt swap problem, removed the unintended fiscal drag in the first 2-3 quarters of 2015. On the monetary policy front, credit growth has picked up steadily since 3Q15</span></p>
