<p><span class="font5">Early in 2022, we </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">formulated</span><span class="font5"> a long-term target for a 2.5% real yield on lOyr USTs. This view was rationalized in a framework which incorporated a set of long-term drivers of real interest rates. Since then, the real yield on lOyr USTs has risen to that level before drawing down in recent weeks. In this note, we assess how long-term structural drivers have evolved since our initial projections, assess whether any changes in our views are warranted by new evidence or insight and discuss factors that are likely to shape the longterm transition path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Source: J.P. Morgan. Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. Bloomberg Finance L.P.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our analysis is based on the economic premise that interest rates are ultimately determined by the supply and demand for capital in an economy - savings and investment. We previously argued that most structural drivers depressed real yields since the 1980s, but that a number of forces were likely to either push real interest rates up or at least moderate into the future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">As summarized in Table 1, the structural forces we anticipated putting upward pressure on real yields included the rising number of older people moving naturally into a dissaving state; rising government debt; rising capital demands to adapt to climate change and mitigate its impact; partial deglobalization or geoeconomic fragmentation; slight reversion of corp orate profit margins; and higher macro volatility. Simultaneously, inequality, EM reserve accumulation, and financial repression which all contributed to the decline in real yields since the 1980s, were seen as likely to stabilize. In our view, these changes were likely to dominate the yield-depressing effects of slower economic growth which would be increasingly concentrated in relatively low investment sectors like healthcare.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
<h6><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Long-term drivers</span></h6>
<p><span class="font5">Now, we assess how long-term structural drivers in our framework have evolved since we made our initial projections, and whether our expectations have changed due to new evidence or insights. In general, we find that the most recent data are broadly consistent with our initial predictions. We modestly revise our expectations of the effects of some factors. We slightly revise down our expectations of the effects of macro volatility, deglobalization and corporate profits, while we revise up our expectations of the effects of changes in sectoral composition. Balancing these revisions, we slightly lower our long-term real interest rate targets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fiscal debt and deficits</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Newer data since early 2022 affirm that global fiscal debt and deficits should continue to put upward pressure on real yields In that time, the long-term trajectory of fiscal debt has deteriorated in many countries, most notably in the US. The dynamics of real yields since that time, and particularly in recent months, suggest quite strongly that fiscal circumstances are one of the principal drivers of yields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the US, the CBO’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Update to the Budget and Economic Outlook</span><span class="font5"> published in July 2021 - the most up-to-date budget projections at the time of our initial forecast - forecast that debt held by the public as a share of GDP would rise to 106.4% by 2031.' As of the CBO’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Long-Tenn Budget Outlook</span><span class="font5"> published in June 2023, debt is forecast to rise to 110.2% of GDP by that time.<sup>2</sup>This deterioration occurred even after accounting for the passage of the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Fiscal Responsibility Act</span><span class="font5"> of 2023, and in spite of a surge in unexpected inflation which appreciably depressed debt relative to GDP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">This longer-term deterioration is perhaps most stark in the US, but is not merely a US phenomenon. Since our initial forecast, the IMF’s forecast of the average budget deficit as a share of GDP in the 2023-2026 window has deteriorated from 3.6% to 4.2% in France, -0.2% (surplus) to 1.5% in Germany, 2.9% to 3.7% in Italy, 2.1% to 3.6% in Japan, 3.2% to 3.9% in the UK, and 5.3% to 7.2% in China.<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, as we have </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">written recently</span><span class="font5">, there are strong reasons to expect that the path of US fiscal debt is likely to be even worse than outlined in the CBO projections.
