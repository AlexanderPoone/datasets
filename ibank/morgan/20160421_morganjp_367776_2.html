<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">General pick up in sentiment from factories</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our recent visit to Haitian International, largest plastic injection molding machinery maker globally, suggest a widespread recovery in demand that is causing many plastic part makers to order new machinery. Haitian is seeing a more robust order flow after the CNY holidays and is running near capacity now to deliver machinery from strong March order flow. The company cited general improvement in end user demand for plastic parts as well as government policies (such as tax rebates and subsidies) that encourages factories to update their equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Price target, valuation and risks. </span><span class="font4">Our PT (Dec-16, DCF-derived) of HK$6.0 implies a forward P/E of 8.lx (FY17E). The key downside risks to our PT are falling demand for construction glass that could result from a cooling property market in China, and further weakness in PV glass demand from Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please see our latest update &quot;</span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Xinyi Glass: Improving gross margins and strong cost controls</span><span class="font4">&quot; dated 15 Mar. for more details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe Xinyi is China's most diversified glass conglomerate. The defensive auto glass aftermarket business and the advanced low emission construction glass business continued to do well with stable growth and steady margins. The key drivers for growth in the rest of this year arc the recovery in margins for the float glass business. In the past, we have seen peak margins for float glass hit 40% when the market is in short supply. We could sec margins recover when demand improves as new supply has slowed to a trickle since the beginning of 2014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our Dec-16 PT is based on a DCF valuation that assumes a market risk premium of 6.0% and a risk-free rate of 4.2% (yield on 10-year government notes in China). We have assumed a beta of 1.3 (Bloomberg Beta is 1.3). Accordingly, WACC is assumed at 11.4%. We have estimated free cash flow for XYG until 2020 and assume a terminal growth rate of 3.0%. The terminal growth is based on the annual growth rate expected in 2020 (the final year of the estimate period) subject to a minimum of 3% and a maximum of 6%, depending on the nature of the industry and the level of maturity in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The key downside risks to our OW rating and PT arc falling demand for construction glass that may result from a cooling property market in China and further weakness in PV glass demand from Europe.</span></p>
