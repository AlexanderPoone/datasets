<p><span class="font3">We had previously factored in no improvement in the net profit per ton achieved in 1 HF Y16 for LMP (no H/H improvement in 2HFY16 and no increase in FY17 or FYI 8). The latest NDP results cause us to re-evaluate this conservative view. The surprisingly strong pricing power shown by NDP (especially its planned price hike in Oct) for 2HCY16 leads us to be more positive on LMP (usually similar to NDP in pricing strategy) and we now assume 2HFY16 net profit margin to improve by 5% H/H to HK$550 per ton (Rmb470 per ton). Longer term, we see better supply discipline in the market (neither LMP or NDP starting new lines in 2016) as a good signal for the market and we now assume a further Y/Y increase of 6% for FY17 to HK$572 per ton and a 4% Y/Y increase to HK$594 per ton for FY18. We assume peakNP/T in FY18 and a small correction by 4-5% in FYI9 as more supply comes on line.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Supply discipline leads us to be more bullish on FY18</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">NDP’s latest results show improved pricing power in 2H16 with 2HFY16 net profit per ton (ex FX) of about Rmb238 compared to Rmbl98 in 1 HF Y16. The real improvement is likely to come in FY17 when we foresee most of the coastal region in a tight containerboard market and a prolonged period of healthy margins. NDP and rival LMP were the two most aggressive players in terms of capacity expansion during the last peak margin period CY09-CY10 adding nearly 40% in capacity from 2010 to 2015 (7-8% CAGR). However, both companies have not announced any new production lines in China for over a year (NDP has one line completing in mid CY18) and we do not expect any new line construction starts until 1Q-2QCY17 for either company. Accordingly, we do not expect much new supply of large modern lines into the China market until the end of CY18.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Further improvement in net profit per ton</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">NDP is still planning to lift prices by 1-1.5% (Rmb30-50 per ton) in October as it is peak season. This is quite positive as the cost of OCC has been trending down since Aug 1 and therefore should start to lower cost of production by the beginning of October. The strong pricing environment in October reflects the strong demand and lack of supply in the industiy. NDP also mentioned inventory levels are very low and the company can sell as much as it can. We maintain our estimate thatNP/T will improve to about Rmb255 for FYI7.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Continual improvements in the market</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">We expect high closures of small mills since 2014 and the lack of new plants going up in China (since 2015) should result in a strong pricing environment for at least two years. NDP can easily finance projects now (new lines) but new licences are difficult to obtain. This is now, in managements’ opinion, the most important reason for not expanding in China.</span></p>
