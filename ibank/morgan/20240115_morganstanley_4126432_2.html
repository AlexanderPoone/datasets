<p><span class="font2">Over the past 50 years, we have identified eight Fed pivots on rates, which we have studied to understand market trading patterns and factor implications before and after. It is interesting to note that the implications depended on whether the pivot was done in a hard or soft landing scenario in the US.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this section, we look at Morgan Stanley's quant database stretching back to 1971 to summarize the historical factor performance and discuss how these factors correlated with macro data, e.g. US dollar, UST bond yields. Our goal is to explore where we are now, and where the market is likely to move in 2024.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Exhibit 2: Historical Fed Pivots Timing vs. US Core Inflation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Market Beta Performance Amid Soft vs. Hard Landing Scenarios</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Our analysis found that the first step is to divide these historical pivot scenarios by the economic outlook - soft vs. hard landing. Exhibits 4 &amp;&nbsp;5 show the different market environments amid soft and hard landing scenarios. Here we show the performance of &quot;Equity Beta&quot; factors before and after the Fed pivots, after fully hedging out sector/ style exposure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The key messages here are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a hard landing scenario (Exhibit 3 ), if a Fed pivot was done to save the economy or equity market amid a systematic risk event, the market tends to keep declining even after the pivot. That means the early stage of a Fed pivot did not help reverse market risk sentiment in this case. Market volatility remained elevated overall.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a soft landing scenario (Exhibit 4 ), if a Fed pivot was done to support economic growth amid a cyclical slowdown with inflation moderation, then markets tend to perform well after the pivot. Even before the pivot, the Fed's forward-looking guidance or messages also started to help restore market risk sentiment. Market volatility was more stable than in a hard landing scenario.</span></p></li></ul>
