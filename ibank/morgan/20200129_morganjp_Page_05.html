<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Xilinx </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Underweight; Price Target: $85.00)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">With longer time to revenue in focus (datacenter) and key (wireless infrastructure) markets versus our prior expectations, and an M&amp;A expectation that we view as unlikely to play out, we believe multiple compression is likely. Given that we see no upside in the stock, we are Underweight on XLNX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Our new PT is at $85, which assumes that the stock trades at a premium 22-24x multiple times 2HFY21 earnings power of $3.70. Given the stock is still trading above our fair value PT, we remain UW the stock. We believe Xilinx should trade at an above-average multiple due to its higher profitability compared to most semiconductor peers with gross margin near 70%. However, with limited upside to our price target, we remain Underweight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The communications end market is the largest end market for Xilinx at ~40% of revenue. Therefore, an unexpected increase in spending on equipment from sendee providers, carriers and business enterprises could have a dramatic positive impact on Xilinx’s revenue, which could cause us to re-address our Underweight rating. Other risks to upside include a faster than expected adoption and ramp of its FPGA/ACAP products in datacenters and a potential interest in XLNX and its assets by a large diversified buyer. Xilinx derives roughly 20% of its revenues from Europe and &gt;40% of its revenues from Asia (ex-Japan), and any notable macroeconomic strength in these regions could positively impact Xilinx’s sales, resulting in upside risks to our estimates.</span></p>
