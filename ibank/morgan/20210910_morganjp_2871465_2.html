<p><span class="font3">There are reasons to rennin confident that strong growth lies ahead. Although the Delta drag has not passed, recent evidence confirms the effectiveness of vaccines in limiting deaths and hospitalizations. With the pace of vaccination now picking up smartly in the areas most impacted by this wave—Asia and Australia—the case for fading drag to generate a growth lift later this year looks good. The continued buoyancy of global financial markets is also encouraging. Asset prices remain elevated in the face of the downsliift in growth momentum with positive news notable in EM where recoveries have lagged (Figure 2). In addition, neither the movement toward central bank tapering nor the continued upward pressure on global inflation has generated a tantrum in global bond markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Persistent supply constraints linked to the limited availability of key inputs and transportation impediments are the greatest immediate threat to growth. The latest readings show delivery timesand transportation costs still near record highs. Last week’s US employment report also points to labor supply constraints. These drags should fade along with the Delta wave and be accompanied by a growth boost from inventory rebuilding. However, the longer constraints linger, the greater the risk that higher consumer prices and the lack of available products as we move toward the holiday shopping season destroy (rather than defer) final demand. This concern should be reinforced next week as we expect both US and China retail sales to have contracted in August.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Look to Asia for signs of fading headwinds</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Signs that supply constraints are easing should be evident first in Asia’s upstream goods-producing economies. China's August trade sent an encouraging signal, with strong shipments to developed markets. Product details highlight firming exports of lower-end consumer goods and steady gains in tech shipments. Bottleneck constraints remain, and some of the increase in nominal exports surely owes to steep price increases. But we believe volume shipments are also on the rise as COVID-related backups at Chinese ports start to fade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Elsewhere in the region, August signals are more mixed. Echoing the recent Korean trade data, Taiwan’s export volumes ticked lower—consistent with July softening in export orders— while export prices jumped. In Japan, real exports posted a robust 1.7% gain in July and we look for another strong 1% gain in next week’s August report. Improving external conditions look to be offset, however, by a reported slump in small-firm sentiment in Japan. According to the Economy Watchers’ Survey for August, auto-related firms pointed to production cutbacks from persistent semiconductor shortages and noted difficulties in getting parts from Southeast Asia. Notably, the survey suggests no immediate easing of the supply bottleneck.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>On a brighter note: Global capex healthy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Alongside a persistent supply crunch, we have been concerned about the latest slide in manufacturing expectations. However, growth in businesses’ equipment spending remains resilient, even if it has downshifted from its recent torrid pace. Data this week from Japan and Taiwan show a solid expansion in domestic capital investment—a welcome sign that businesses are looking through the near-term difficulties. In Asia, Taiwan’s August capital goods imports posted strong gains and indicators point to a large gain in next week’s Japan July machinery orders. Globally, our CapexNow shows equipment investment decelerating but still expanding ata solid 6.6%ar this quarter—a 0.5%-ptupgrade this week (Figure 3). That businesses continue to invest supports the view that near-term headwinds should fade.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Expecting a soft turn for the better in China</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of greater importance for the outlook for China is the anticipated rebound in domestic demand that we expect to accompany a shift toward policy stimulus. An acceleration in government bond issuance boosted overall total social financing in this week’s August report, suggesting this turn is underway. Together with the rise in China's imports of key industrial metals in August, a pickup in infrastructure projects should soon boost FAI growth. However, with C0VID fears still present at midyear, we expect retail sales contracted l%m/m last month after a 0.5% drop in July. On balance, we project IP to have just edged up 0.3% last month.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>DM CBs to gradually scale back QE...</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As recoveries have advanced and inflation has surprised to the upside, DM central banks are proceeding with plans to scale back their balance sheet policies. They are not ignoring the incomplete progress toward recovery, however, or the recent rise in downside risks. Balancing these considerations, they are signaling that asset purchases will be tapered but continue</span></p>
