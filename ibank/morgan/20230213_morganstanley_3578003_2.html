<h6><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Why We Believe It's not The End Of Growth Rotation in Asia/EM</span></h6>
<p><span class="font1">Two Key Market Dynamics vs. Their Style Implications</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">#1 - Financial Conditions Re-tightening &amp;&nbsp;A Pause of Growth Rotation</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">Global financial conditions have started to ease since October last year with declining DXY and UST10Y yield. These macro backdrops brought fund inflows toward Asia/EM, favoring its high Growth and high Beta equities to lead the rally. However, there are signs that investors are reversing their expectations on the Fed rate outlook, and therefore, certain degrees of portfolio re-balancing is on-going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The catalyst was the hawkish messages from different Fed officials post a robust Jan payroll number release. Exhibit 3 shows that the bond futures market is now expecting another 50bps Fed rate hike in the upcoming FOMC meetings, while the rate cut expectation in 2024 is Lowering. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">As a result, the performance of long duration assets globally was under headwinds in the near term, and the outperformance of EM Growth vs. Value has taken a pause amid the recent rising US treasury 10Y yield (Exhibit 4).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">Yet the up-tick of DXY was only marginal (Exhibit 5), while implied volatility of US Treasury bonds remained stable (Exhibit 6). That implies that a significant turnaround of financial conditions to tighten quickly is still perceived as Low probability by the majority of investors, we believe.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">From a quant perspective, we suggest to closely monitor the price actions in the bond futures market post the release of Jan US inflation data on Feb 14, which might come with upside surprise vs. consensus. According to our US economist, our team expects the upcoming CPI print to be 0.43% MoM for core and 0.54% MoM for headline (vs. consensus at 0.40% MoM on both core and headline). If the upside surprise is translated into a further increase of US terminal rate expectations, then we might see Asia/EM Growth stocks remain struggling for Longer, or even turn to underperform Value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The most bearish scenario is a spike in the MOVE Index, which means a substantial tightening in financial conditions is perceived by a majority of investors, we believe. If that happens, we might need to close our style preference of Growth over Value in Asia/EM. At this stage, we believe the risk of running into this scenario is very Low, and we still prefer Growth over Value in Asia/EM; but we have to be nimble if market dynamics change quickly.</span></p>
