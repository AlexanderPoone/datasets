<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growth expectations remain positive. </span><span class="font1">Approximately 83% of respondents anticipate growth in demand conditions over the next 12 months, slightly lower than -88%/89% in our prior surveys, with ~34% expecting &gt;10% growth vs ~41%/44% in the prior surveys. Keep in mind, as always, that responses are typically biased on optimism in forward expectations, and actual growth tends to fall below expectations as we’ve seen in prior surveys. On backlog visibility, -39% said they were at normal levels (vs -32% in prior survey) and -48% at stronger than normal levels (vs -50% in prior survey), which is in line with the prior survey. Expectations are similar as compared to our last survey for client capex as -73% expect it to be up in 2022 (vs -73% in prior survey) with -3 8% seeing 5%+ growth (vs -45% in prior survey) and -35% of respondents seeing -0-5% (vs -28% in prior). For 2023 capex, -70% of respondents were positive, with -42% expecting 5%+ growth and -29% expecting -0-5% growth. For ROK, we assume organic growth of 9.6% in FY22 and 7.5% growth in FY23. At EMR, we model FY22 organic sales up 8.9% (up 7% for Automation), followed by 2.9% in FY23 (4% in Automation). At Siemens DI we look for 11%/3.2% like-for-like growth in 2022E/2023E after 12.7% growth in 2021. At Schneider Industry Automation, we model 8.4%/5.1% like-for-like growth for 2022E/2023E following 10.7% growth in 2021. At ABB, we look for Robotics &amp;&nbsp;Discrete Automation to grow 6%/14% in 2022E/2023E in comparable terms after 9% growth in 2021 while we look for revenues to increase 7%/5% in 2022E/2023E in comparable terms for the Process Automation segment after 5% growth in 2021.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;End market leadership evolving. </span><span class="font1">On end markets, sentiment appears most favorable for markets like Data Centers, Entertainment, Semiconductor &amp;&nbsp;Electronics and Packaging while sentiments for markets like Commercial/Institutional, Automotive &amp;&nbsp;Tire and Building Automation were largely negative. Looking at B2B across end markets, Oil &amp;&nbsp;Gas responses are showing some improvement with -29% seeing B2B at &gt;lx vs -21% prior in Oil &amp;&nbsp;Gas. There have been some moderation in Auto &amp;&nbsp;Tire and Food &amp;&nbsp;Bev as -17% are seeing &gt;1.0x vs -25% prior in Auto &amp;&nbsp;Tire, while book-to-bill at Food &amp;&nbsp;Bev -31% is seeing &gt;1.0x vs -40% in the prior survey.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MES/IoT adoption moderates. </span><span class="font1">Responses suggest that the MES market adoption continues to be relatively slow, with some viewing this product as more of an order management system versus the data analytics platforms needed. The trend and commentary were more cautious with respect to the prior survey. Roughly -31% of respondents described MES adoption as minimal (versus ~20%/~15% in prior two surveys) and -22% described it as improving materially (vs ~22%/~29% in prior two surveys). Responses were split when asked about approach, which is most effective and is seeing greatest acceptance in the market between the automation supplier partnering with software partner and fully integrated offering from automation control system suppliers. When asked about share shifts due to software, most said &quot;none.&quot; However, the majority of those that did answer that they are seeing share shift cited Emerson as winning share from Siemens and Schneider while Rockwell is holding up strong. This said, they highlighted ROK/PLEX as likely to succeed, about the same as Aveva/OSI, while they viewed HON/Sparta as having &quot;little impact.&quot;</span></p></li></ul>
