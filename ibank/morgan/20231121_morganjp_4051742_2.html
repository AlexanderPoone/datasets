<p><span class="font3">tue of being an attractive carry-positive risk hedge. Separately, inflation risk premium is still alive. This was an evident support to the dollar via the US rates shock in 3Q/early 4Q when bond/equity co Delation once again broached 2022 levels. With the run rate on Fed’s inflation measure still running high, markets will still remain sensitive to such re-pricings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Third, the market is more eager to position for dollar weakness than for dollar strength. Aside from the skewness of views in client conversations - often informed by US fiscal concents and rich long-iun valuations- it has also been apparent in price action: vol of DXY up days has on average been smaller than that on down days, even excluding the outsized risk rally in QI. This pattern is not simply a function ofposi-tioning. Take-away is that if growth outside the US is turning up, one should be quick to reduce dollar longs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fourth, the dollar is resistant to rising US rates when RoW growth is doing well or if US rates are rising on term premia. On the former, 2Q23 saw a 140bp hawkish re-pricing of the Fed’s terminal rate but the broad dollar was range-bound (as market pricing for other central banks was able to keep up with the Fed). It was only in 2H when growth in China and the Eurozone started to weaken, that the dollar caught up to higher US rates. On term premia, the reduced sensitivity of some pairs to US rates was evident when US rates were rising without a Fed re-think. The beta of of USD/JPY to a 1% change in US yields ex-term premium is 7.4%, but this beta drops to half for term premium. The take-away is that if the rise in US rates comes amid solid growth in RoW or due to rising US tenn premium, expect USD to undershoot rates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Fifth. Chinese reflation today is not what it used to be. Part of it is the nature of the stimulus itself, aimed at managing downside ingrowth than promoting upside, and constrained by the ongoing deleveraging in the systemically important housing sector. The correlation between China growth fluctuations and capital flows into China has weakened considerably, and is asymmetric: growth downturns spur large outflows, but upturns do not lead to equivalent inflows. Forward looking implication: upturns in China growth may not have the same reflationary / USD-depressive effect that they may have had in the past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, FX intervention can impact even DM FX. In EM FX, CNY and INR vol was reduced to near-zero in Q3 by large scale CB intervention and jawboning. The act of intervention was not a surprise, but the scale of it was. We learnt that similar jawboning strategies can work in DM too, as illustrated by USD/JPY’s flat-lining sub-150. Of a different flavor, FX reserve hedging had a short-lived but meaningful impact on SEK. Forward looking implication: FX intervention or reserve management was never really an issue in DM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">FX strategy, but may become more germane going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2024: From hikes to synchronized cuts</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Going into 2024, the macro backdrop remains challenging with dispersion in market participants view on the macro outlook remains wide, spanning from soft-landing, additional Fed hikes to recession. Needless to say, FX market participants will need to navigate the transition among these scenarios tactically as they would imply different outcomes for the dollar (more on this below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Key inputs to consider for our baseline view include:</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(1) A large nu mber of central banks will start cutting policy rates (Figure 2), but policy rates will nonetheless remain elevated even by end of 2024 (Figure 3). The start of cutting cycles which granularly will be led by the very highest yielders should lend itself to the creation of a myriad of new trading themes (and the receding of ones that dominated in 2023). Yields on carry baskets will fall to sub-average by mid-2024. This should make (a) FX carry less attractive and a narrower theme as the year progresses, (b) reduce the pressure on currencies with highly levered economies as well as on the funders, particularly the lower-yielding high beta FX that are now cheap, (c) allow FX markets to respond to other factors like growth or ones that have become quite stretched (like value), (d) provide a fresh set of high beta currencies to underweightvs. USD as hedges as they traverse from high-yielders to low-yielders, and (e) generate RV opportunities motivated by relative sequencing of cuts (just as rate hikes didin 2023).</span></p>
