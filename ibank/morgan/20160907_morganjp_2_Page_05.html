<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong 1H16 results: </span><span class="font2">Sinopharm reported strong 1H16 results with sales growing 15% and net profit surging 29% YoY on other gains of Rmb427mn; Excluding other gains, net profit grew 17% YoY, above industry growth of 10%. More positively, AR days improved to 100 days vs 115 days in 2015 and financial cost decreased by 13% YoY at 0.79% of sales, down from 1.04% in 1H15. However, operating cash flow was down to Rmbl.6bn from Rmbl.8bn in 1H15 on longer collection period from hospitals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New regulations on pharmaceutical sector are positive to the sector as whole and large players like Sinopharm. </span><span class="font2">The roll out of new regulations on the sector, i.e. VAT’s replacement of business tax, Two-invoicing system and new GSP standards, are beneficial to the sector as a whole especially large players like Sinopharm. Given that VAT is expected to be cheaper than the business tax, management expects tax expenses to be lower in future. For new GSP standards, although a few small affiliate distributors have failed the GSP assessment, the negative impact is minimal and it should be offset by the benefit from improvement of overall service quality in the sector. For the two-invoicing system, which is expected to be implemented by 2017, it will standardize the process of drug distribution across the nation and therefore drive away inefficient, small players, which is also positive to the sector. Despite stricter regulations, management expects Sinopharm to continue grow at 2-3% faster than the industiy average in 2016.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eye on M&amp;A of retail businesses supported by stable OCF and low cost debts. </span><span class="font2">Management is eying retail business acquisition especially in retail channels such as 1) direct-to-pharmacy (DTP), 2) in-hospital drug stores and 3) near-hospital drug store. It will also help the company's competitiveness as small, social distributors are not capable to do so.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Share incentive scheme will incentivize managements towards long term growth of the company. </span><span class="font2">In Aug-2016, Sinopharm announced a share incentive scheme that will take effect for 10 years once adopted. The key of the scheme mentioned by management is that the granting of shares is based its ROE and net profit growth compared to industiy. According to the announcement, the key performance assessment targets are as follow:</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2016: ROE&gt;11.5% &amp;&nbsp;Net profit grew at a CAGR of &gt;12% based on 2015;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2017: ROE&gt;12.7% &amp;&nbsp;Net profit grew at a CAGR of&gt;12% based on 2015;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2018: ROE&gt;12.7% &amp;&nbsp;Net profit grew at a CAGR of&gt;12% based on 2015;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2019: ROE&gt;12.8% &amp;&nbsp;Net profit grew at a CAGR of&gt;12% based on 2015.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sinopharm will continue to expand its innovative business </span><span class="font2">such as pharmaceutical e-commerce, financial leasing, agent business, third-party logistics, medical equipment, etc. According to the management, the company has invested cRmblbn in its financial leasing business.</span></p></li></ul>
