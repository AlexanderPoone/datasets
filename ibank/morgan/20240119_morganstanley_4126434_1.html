<p><span class="font7">4Q Preview: Improving EPS Outlook</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Expect better 4Q earnings given market rally into year-end boosting fund NAVs that drives our 5% upward EPS revision. Higher AUM levels support improved 2024-25 outlook with 12%/8% upward EPS revision. We also see scope for a better flow outlook in '24 as we anticipate gradual risk re-engagement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Key Takeaways:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better market performance into year-end relative to the soft Oct start supports upward revisions though not enough to drive seq. EPS growth. Expect flows remain pressured by weak risk appetite and seasonally softer MF flows that likely see ~3% outflows (vs ~1% outflows in 3Q23).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to 2024, we anticipate risk re-engagement given views of our economists for falling inflation, rate cuts from June and a soft Landing. In such a backdrop, we expect Large piles ofcash on the sidelines to rotate into fixed income and would also expect improved equity flows over time.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On 4Q calls, we'll be listening for mgmt commentary around; 1) client risk re-engagement trends, particularly Jan YTD and organic growth outlook, 2) expense outlook and growth initiatives, 3) capital mgmt priorities including scope for strategic actions/M&amp;A to drive improved growth prospects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group rallied 21% over the past 3-months (vs. S&amp;P up 11%), but declined -3% YTD (vs. S&amp;P -0.6% YTD) vs. our broader coverage -4% YTD. Valuations at 9.3x EV/EBITDA are roughly in Line with 9.4x EV/EBITDA that the group historically traded on avg, and well above prior troughs at ~6x.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We raise 4Q estimates by +5% on an average basis, and we're -0.4% below cons; We're most below the street in 4Q for BSIG and TROW, by -6.5% and -4.8% and most above for VCTR and BEN, by +4.5% and +2.3%</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our 2024-25 EPS estimates rise +TI.7%/+7.6% on average basis on higher AUM Levels given the recent broad based uplift in financial markets. 2024 ests increase most for IVZ (and tactically more positive) and Least for WT.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain cautious on the outlook for the Trads but have selectively added risk as we see greater prospects for a soft landing and improved macro outlook that can support flows and fund NAVs. However we see structural challenges to organic growth and fee rates (given evolving customer preferences and performance challenges), and expenses (given need to invest in the business Linked to regulation, data and technology and to drive growth) that weigh on earnings power and profitability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Remain Overweight BLK and recently elevated to Top Pick, given exposure to secular growth zones (privates, EM, solutions, Fl, Aladdin tech+AI efficiencies) and best mix of product, distribution breadth and scale to support organic growth and better than expected earnings power.</span></p>
