<p><span class="font5">US GDP growth is poised to moderate following last year’s 3% gain, but expectations for quicker and larger policy easing need to be tempered against a recent easing of financial conditions. At the same time, the rapid realized pace of supply growth (the labor force and productivity strengthened 1.3% and 2.2%, respectively, in 2023) is likely to cool. From a lofty 3.5% realized potential gain last year we are forecasting US gains to slow to below 2% this year. This week’s employment report points in this direction and suggests the midyear drift upwards in the US unemployment rate has been arrested, despite moderating job gains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">By contrast the Euro area stagnated last year with an even weaker supply-side performance that pushed its unemployment rate lower. For the ECB to hold its current restrictive stance in 1H24, it must be confident that the region will return to growth. This week brought some encouraging news on that front as the Euro area composite PMI was revised up in the final report for December, consolidating November’s increase. There was also better news on bank lending and German labor demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Resilience doesn’t deliver convergence</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The data flow reinforces our call for near-term growth resilience. We forecast just over 2%ar growth in 4Q23 and 1Q24, slightly below potential. This week’s J.P. Morgan Global PMI advanced further to end the year at a level consistent with 2.5%ar global GDP growth. Encouragingly, this move arrests a sharp five-month slide through October. A move up in the employment PMI bolsters this gain. Yet the growth gaps that opened up last year persist. Sectorally, the firming in the PMI owed entirely to a large gain in services that more than offset a drop back in the manufacturing PMI—its seventh month running below the 50-mark. Following a full year of stagnation, a modest recoveiy in factory output—to a roughly 1.5%ar—took hold in 2H23. But this lift appears to be narrowly linked to a rebound in Asia tech and a firming in the pace of stock building. With the new orders-to-inventoiy ratio of the PMIs still firmly in contractionary territory (Figure 3), this expansion does not have a firm footing. However, we take some comfort in the latest indicators that show final goods demand still rising—helped in part by signs of a pickup in global capex following a midyear stall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Geographically, Western Europe continues to straggle, and China looks fragile. A surprisingly weak December ISM employment reading notwithstanding, the latest US business surveys overall underscore solid US momentum carrying into the new year. In Europe, an upward revision to the PMI is welcome but does more to remove downside risk than to change our view of an economy that is stagnating around the turn of the year. The main disappointment in this week’s data comes from China, where the more domestically-oriented NBS PMIs flagged ongoing weakness—despite improvement in the S&amp;P Global PMI (which is in our global measure).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Divergences in Asian manufacturing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We are also mindful of the ongoing divergences between tech and non-tech Asian manufacturing, as evident in the relative regional outperformance of tech-heavy Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore (Figure 4). Tech continues to lead production and shipments in Korea (benefiting from a strong DRAM lift), while broader non-tech production has weakened. Meanwhile, factory output is straggling in the more auto-dominat-ed Japan, where production and exports recorded monthly declines through November. Taiwan’s export and industrial activity has shown steady sequential growth since midyear, but November export orders disappointed while this week’s December PMIs gave back months of recent gains. By contrast, the new orders PMIs from Korea, Vietnam, and Mainland China posted more constructive gains. On balance, we are upbeat on tech sector activity for 2024, owing to expected gains in demand for AI and high-performance computing and fading destocking pressures.</span></p>
