<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">As mentioned above, overseas expansion has become a key trend for port operators, particularly since China revealed its ambitious plans to revive the old Silk Road trade routes. </span><span class="font6">As a result, competition for overseas acquisitions has been increasing making it very difficult to find 'bargain' deals anymore (valuations of recent deals have gone up while expected returns have seen downward pressure).</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus, we believe both CP and CMHI would benefit from co-investing more as it would allow both companies to do more deals (and hence potentially broaden their networks more than they would be able to if they ventured overseas alone) while reducing competition (which could help control valuations). </span><span class="font6">Furthermore, as a unified investor, a JV between CMHI and CP may have more bargaining power given their overseas track record and parent group support. And lastly, this could bring the two companies closer together which may allow the two companies to leverage off of each others' port networks while CMHI would get the added bonus of benefitting from potential volume support given CP's close relationship with COSCO shipping (and the new OCEAN alliance).</span></p>
