<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Looking at the company’s EBIT and adjusted EBITDA forecasts, we currently expect a dip in FY16 as the newly consolidated ports will have lower profitability </span><span class="font2">(as illustrated above through the dilution of revenue yields). That said, port operators tend to have high operating leverage and thus with scaling volumes (even though we only assume mild growth), we should see rising EBIT profitability (in addition, the company is expected to have higher operating expenses this year due to US$5MM of one off legal fees booked during the first quarter). For adjusted EBITDA, we also forecast a decline in FY16E as the container leasing assets are swapped out for CSPD’s ports assets, most of which are associate and JCE companies (hence contributions not reflected in the consolidated EBIT line) but see stable growth going forward as both consolidated operations and associate/JCE profits are forecast to trend upwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Turning to the company’s ROE, we see that ROE from continuing operations (core profits) will dip in FY16E, </span><span class="font2">largely as a result of lower asset turnover, attributable to the fact that most of CSPD's ports are associates and joint ventures and thus have no consolidated revenue impact (but has enlarged the asset base) while lower profitability was unable to offset this negative factor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We anticipate leverage to rise over the next couple of years while the company remains active in the acquisition market and see overall profitability gradually trending upwards. </span><span class="font2">Hence, we forecast ROE to rise over time but do not expect it to rebound sharply as it will take time to improve the profitability of CSPD’s port assets.</span></p>
