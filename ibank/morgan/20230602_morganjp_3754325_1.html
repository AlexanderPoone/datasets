<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thedebt ceiling standoffis nowbehind us, and marketswill need to confront the impacts of a rapid rebuild of the TGA that will likely bring nearly $lTn in T-bill issuance in coming months. We expect the sharp rise in the TGA to be mostly offset by a decline in Reserves, with RRP balances likely to decline only modestly. If this proves correct, this will add another source of downward pressure on deposits, on top of still-ongoing deposit-to-MMF migration as well as QT. We update our Fed balance sheet liabilities forecast to capture all these factors</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supply tends to matter little for T-bill valuations. Therefore, we believe the recent cheapening in 3M T-bills versus swaps has less to do with impending supply and more to do with T-bill avoidance during the debt ceiling standoff by liquidity investors. This is thus likely to reverse, which should pressure front end swap spreads wider towards fair value - initiate exposure to wider front end swap spreads</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swap spreads in much of the belly of the curve are near fair value and leave us neutral, but swap spreads remain wide in the 5 Y sector. We recommend positioning fora correction via 4s/5s swap spread curve flatteners, which additionally seeks to take advantage of slide along the term stiucture of swap spreads</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the swap yield curve, we recommend positioning for a flatter 3s/7s curve either with a 35% risk weighted long in 5s to take advantage of the current mispricing as wellasslide</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... or conditionally via payer swaptions. Current swaption implied volatility levels allow a 3M expiry 3s/7s bearflattener to be constructed premium neutral by selling20% risk in 3Mx5Ypayer swaptions, while the realized beta is likely to be larger. Thus, such a trade benefits from the current steepness of the curve, continued conditional exposure to flattening in a selloff, as well as positive slide with the passage of time</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied volatility declined sharply this week, but the underlying factors driving our bullish view on gamma have not changed - remain bullish on gamma, but unwind relative value tail switches into long tails that have sliaiply underperformed recently</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we find value in swaption straddle calendar spreads - buy 6Mx30Y volatility versus selling a vega-neutral a mountof </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">1Yx30Y</span><span class="font4"> as an efficientway of constructing long gamma exposure in long tails</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 5s/30s swap curve is tightly correlated to 2-year yields, but 5s/30s YCSO implied volatility appears rich relative to swaption volatility on 2Y tails given the empirical relationship - sell 9M expiry single look swaddles on the 5s/30s CMS curve, versus buying 35% of the vega risk in 9Mx2Y swaption swaddles</span></p></li></ul>

<p><span class="font4">The past few weeks have been characterized by an increasing focus on debt ceiling developments, given the fast approaching X-date in early June. That standoff has now been resolved in time to avoid crossing the X-date. The House passed a bill on Wednesday night that suspends the debt ceiling until early 2025, with the Senate following suit on Thursday night, which effectively resolved matters in the nick of time. Thankfully, this episode of the debtceiling drama will likely come to anend without lasting economic damage from the standoff itself, and the fiscal tightening embedded in the deal is fairly modest at 0.2% of GDP. With the debt ceiling soon to be non-binding, attention now shifts to the upcoming rebuild of the</span></p>
