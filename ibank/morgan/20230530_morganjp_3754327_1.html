<p><span class="font6">China continues to fade - reiterate the peaking in Eurozone vs the US trade</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a sharp -60% rally during Nov-Jan, on the back of the reopening drive, MSCI China has lost 20% since. Our China strategy team </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">believes </span><span class="font9">MSCI China can trade within the team’s base and downside case target (54-66) between now and a good part of 2H. Chinese economic momentum continued to accelerate for a bit longer than the equity indices this year, with a strong 12% qoq sa GDP print for QI, but has softened since.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest set of China economic numbers, for April, has underwhelmed, including IP, retail sales and FAI. This is joining peaking PMIs, 20% lower iron ore price from highs, as well as a big slowdown in China CESI. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">The concern is weak confidence, </span><span class="font9">which has restricted the path to broadened recovery. Our economic team </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">does not anticipate meaningful new stimulus measures for the rest of the year. </span><span class="font9">In the near term, key drivers of growth appear to be </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">softening</span><span class="font9">. The consumer might not get stronger, FAI and property are both structurally challenged, the external backdrop might not help and geopolitics could stay tough.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Internal consumer mobility metrics have fully recovered, </span><span class="font9">such as subway ridership and domestic flights, but granted there is more to go on the external front. Unlike in the US and Europe, though, there might not be much pent up demand, as Chinese consumers didn’t enjoy significant cash transfers during Covid lockdowns, and there are reports of wage cuts in certain industries. More than half of the increase in the Chinese savings rate seen last year has already unwound.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property market has stabilized, post the sharp fall in activity - where new builds are 30-40% below last 3 year ranges. The weaker levels of activity look set to stay, as new land sales are lower 30% ytd. The house prices are at risk of incremental weakening on rising secondary market listings. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Tier 1 house prices in China are not dissimilar to what was observed in Japan in 1990, in terms of affordability.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FAI and infrastructure spend could continue to lag, absent a fresh policy stimulus. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">FAI </span><span class="font9">shares of GDP remain very high, compared to other countries. Fiscal stimulus has been frontloaded in QI, and even though the M2 is moving up, there might not be much further credit easing in the pipeline.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that China exposure baskets might keep disappointing. Our </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">China basket has rolled over </span><span class="font9">- JPGLCHRO Index, and is losing money this year, post the strong start. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We think this could continue, </span><span class="font9">and more broadly we </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">remain</span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;"> UW Value vs Growth style this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China reopening was one of the big supports for Europe trade, where Eurozone beat the US by 30%+ since last September to most recently, in USD terms. The likely China rollover is one of tire reasons why we decided to cut this trade earlier in tire </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">month</span><span class="font9">. With this closure, we have tire OWs on tire following regions globally: </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Japan - </span><span class="font9">upgraded to OW in </span><span class="font9" style="text-decoration:underline;">December</span><span class="font9">, </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">UK -</span><span class="font9">record cheap with the highest dividend yield and lower than 1 beta to global equities, and </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">Switzerland </span><span class="font9">- with a clear Defensive allocation and also lower tiran 1 beta.</span></p></li></ul>
