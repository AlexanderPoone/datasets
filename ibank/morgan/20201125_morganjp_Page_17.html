<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ulker - corporate governance credentials is a caveat for share price performance</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Ulker is a value trap, trading at 5.4x 21E EV/EBITDA and trades at a large discount to European food producers’ ll-17x multiple. However, given its deteriorated corporate governance credentials which we think overshadow its positive earnings momentum, the valuation gap to global food producers could remain for some time. In our view, the key issues are: 1) its cash management where the company maintains a high level of cash on the B/S whilst continuing to finance its debt repayments with new issues in USD, and 2) its unexpected intra group lending to a highly leveraged parent company in Q3 at a much cheaper interest rate than its cost of debt. These developments reduce the transparency for the shares in our view and could disappoint the expectations of investors who might prefer Ulker to resume paying dividends. Aside from these issues, the company continues to over-deliver on growth and profitability expectations, supported by its increasing footprint in MENA as well as product/price mix in the favor of higher margins.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Investor sentiment differs for Turkish food retailers as they are COVID-19 beneficiaries, with Migros an outlier</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Turkish Food retailers trade at an average 28% discount to CEEMEA peers, with BIM an outlier, trading at premium. The structural underlying currents are online shopping and accelerated space expansion while the shift from in-home to out-of-home is likely to stabilize elevated Turkish LFLs at a lower level, close to inflation trends in 2021. BIM is leading the sector in terms of growth, supported by improved SKU offering, accelerated space expansion and increased focus on non-food spot campaigns that drives a better traffic to its stores vs peers. However, under normalized 2021 revenue outlook, the fundamental story in Turkish retailers is likely to shift to companies that have potential to accelerate their earnings momentum. Migros is likely to differentiate itself with earnings turning to positive helped by: 1) a rapidly deleveraged Balance Sheet; 2) a return to shopping malls and tourism centers that make up 15% of its revenues; and 3) continued expansion in online offering. Sok, on the other hand, will continue to benefit from operational leverage yet at a slower pace. We are OW on both Migros and Sok, while N on fairly valued BIM.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">For aviation stocks, releasing a widely available vaccine globally is undeniably the first step towards a recovery for the sector. However, we think it will take multi years to return to 2019 levels, as not every country will have access to a vaccine as much as it is desired. This is likely to continue to put pressure on long haul flights. Furthermore, airlines such as Turkish Airlines, which have a higher share of transit passengers, may take longer to recover than point-to-point carriers. Turkish Airlines generates 75% of its revenues from international passengers and more than half of these are transit passengers. The company has been shifting its focus to tourism in recent years, which should help it to benefit from a recovery tourism globally and more specifically Turkey itself. However, this is already incorporated into our forecasts, where we expect 21E EBITDA to reach 2019 levels. Further, we are seeing easing pressure on liquidity in 2021, boosted by postponed aircraft arrivals with increased delivery time from 2.4 years to 6. The shares currently trade at a fair 21E</span></p>
