<p><span class="font4">The market is flitting from theme to theme, unveiling underlying fragility. In recent weeks we have noted that even with sticky inflation and a central bank re-pricing, 2023 isn’t like 2022 yet. The difference arose from two key factors—growth and the pace of central bank hikes. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The former (growth) remains intact, at least based on data in hand, but the latter (pace of central bank hikes) has been challenged </span><span class="font4">in recent weeks. In detail, positive growth momentum continues to be broad-based, global in nature and encompasses the US as well. This has been indicated by our economists’ growth forecast revisions which have now been upgraded substantially for nearly 40% of the economies we cover, and are also reflected in our timelier economic activity surprise indices while are still net-positive for GIO and EM (exhibit 1). The key contention for markets, however, has shifted to the pace of central bank hikes, most notably the Fed where 50bp was put on the table, compounded by US regional banking stress for good measure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">USD: Wait for it...</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Where does the dollar go from here? The short answer is, it’s complicated. </span><span class="font4">And candidly, if the discussion below outlines one tiling, it is how tenuous the macro backdrop and sentiment really is.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Questions and thoughts that we are mulling for the dollar from a macro standpoint are:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">First - in the very near term, much depends on whether the Fed shifts to 50bp hikes (so watch US CPI </span><span class="font4">next week) and whether </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">broader risk sentiment </span><span class="font4">including that stemming from regional banks continues to deteriorate. Last week, we had noted </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">USD can resume weakening if US terminal rates were to stabilize in March even at higher levels, but a scenario of the Fed having to move to 50bps should be considered a regime-shift in favour of USD-strength </span><span class="font4">(bottom right quadrant, exhibit 2). Our economists’ base case is still for25bp but 50bp remains on the table based on market pricing. The grid in exhibit 2 continues to highlight our view in various scenarios, with a 50bp hike associated with the bottom ride quadrant. A broader deleveraging would like the bottom right quadrant as well, but with carry experiencing drawdowns.</span></p>
