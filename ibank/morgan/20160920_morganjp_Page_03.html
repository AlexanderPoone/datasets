<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PC demand looking stronger. </span><span class="font1">On Friday, Intel raised its 3Q16 guidance range (by 5%) on inventory replenishment in the PC supply chain and improved PC demand. We had recently highlighted seeing upward revisions to 3Q ODM notebook builds. Our initial read on strong ODM data was that US brands may be aggressively building channel inventories to strengthen their market share as Apple’s MacBook Pro refresh seems later than expected. While this is likely to be one of the reasons for strong 3Q builds, we now believe lean supply chain inventories exiting 2Q and better demand trends for 2-in-l notebooks, US geography, and gaming PCs are also contributing to this upside. J.P. Morgan’s Asian technology team believes that PC datapoints could remain on the uptrend given supportive comps, extremely low expectations and low inventories until the end of the year and expect the Asia PC supply chain (Compal, Quanta and Asus) will likely witness a tradable rally through the year-end and outperform the Asian semiconductor supply chain. Please see the report </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">“PCs - Intel 3Q better; positive datapoints continue</span><span class="font1">” dated 19 Sept by the J.P. Morgan Asian Technology team for more details</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Laminates benefit from stronger PC demand. </span><span class="font1">Since 2011, KBL suffered as laminates related to PCs (motherboard, hard drives) slumped from 40% of sales in 2010 to about 20% today. KBL managed to offset this slump with a boost in laminates produced for three key new segments (autos, LED lighting and healthcare) while achieving modest growth in laminates for handsets and home electronics (the other two major sentiments). With the largest drag on demand (PCs) recovering and improving property market helping appliance related demand, we see overall strong market for laminates in 2016 and even better for 2017.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Higher prices for laminates in 2H16. </span><span class="font1">KBL achieved 14.8% EBIT margins in 1H16 (up from 12.3% in 1H15) and the increase was mainly due to the cost of raw materials (40% copper, 20% petrochemical based) coming down Y/Y faster than selling prices. KBL announced a headline 10% price increase around the beginning of July (for core glass laminates products) and effectively achieved about 5% increase(large customers typically can have discounts over headline prices) and we estimate that the costs of production remains stable from 1H16 to 2H16. We now lift our EBITM for laminates in 2H16 by 2.5% compared to 1H16 to reflect some of the benefits of the price increases announced by KBL at the beginning of July. This is still fairly conservative and 2H16 margin improvement could be even higher if the price increase stick until the rest of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">PCB demand and margins heading up. </span><span class="font1">PCB demand should rise alongside lam inates as the custom er profile is quite sim ilar. 1H16 EBITM rose to 4% (1H15 EBIT of 1.2%) and we expect a 2H16 EBITM of 6-7%. There is still more upside in PCB margin which has peaked at 12-14% in past period of strong demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Chemical prices and margins improving. </span><span class="font1">KBC produces a number of chemicals but methanol and phenol related demand has historically provided 60-80% of the EBIT for this division in normal periods. However, the chemicals business has been hovering around breakeven (low 2-3% EBITM) over the past 2 years and only achieved 2.2% EBITM in 1H16. Demand is improving as construction (including appliances and residential related electronics) is the key source of demand for these chemicals. We can see in the charts below the improvement in prices since the end of June 2016 and we expect EBITM for the chemicals division to rise to 4-5% in 2H16. We assume 5% in 2017 which is still much lower than the peak 10-12% EBITM that this division has achieved in previous periods of peak demand.</span></p>
