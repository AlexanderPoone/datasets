<p><span class="font5">In recent years, a number of commercial exhibitors have introduced their own non-conventional theatres in the PRC, including China Giant Screen, Wanda X-Land and CJ CGV’s 4DX etc. Dolby’s theatre screen is entering the China market this year as well. The emergence of these non-conventional screens has so far had no meaningful impact on the demand for IMAX theatres and more or less played a complementaiy role by offering more choices to customers. This, in our view, is due to two reasons: 1) IMAX’s strong brand recognition and proven track record in China. Theatres leverage the intangible value of the IMAX brand to differentiate themselves and to project a premier image; 2) IMAX offers better viewing experience compared to the other non-conventional screens to varying degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, there remains a risk of reduced demand for IMAX systems, or reduced bargaining power for IMAX China in terms of box office sharing arrangement as the competitors continue to develop recognition and optimize their technologies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We see Dolby Cinema, which is entering the China market this year, as the biggest threat. It offers a premium experience with proprietaiy technology and audio elements and also benefits from a premium brand name. Dolby has started rolling out with AMC in the U.S. The initial audience feedback may have been positive, given AMC has accelerated timeline of rollouts from originally 50 screens in four years to only 1.5 years. However, it is still too early to tell what the impact might be on IMAX’s business and market share given there are so few screens at this point.</span></p>
