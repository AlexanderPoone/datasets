<p><span class="font5">The March CPI print should reflect persistent and powerful inflation pressures. A handful of concerning trends compound on past sources of upside and risk pushing up longer term inflation expectations even further. The core CPI should maintain the steady pace of monthly gains around 0.6%m/m, sa, that has been in place for the past six months, but well above the roughly 0.35% mean for the past five years. Within the core, the most immediate source of pressure is goods prices, particularly processed food, which we expect to rise l%m/m, sa for a second consecutive month. Processed food prices have been buffeted by a combination of high prices for raw food and energy, important inputs in the production and distribution process. Given ongoing increases in the prices of these inputs, there should be no relief in processed food inflation in coming months, at least. To put this in perspective, our monthly forecast implies the 3m/3m annualized run rate would stand at 11.9% in March, one-tenth short of the fastest rate seen in at least the past two decades (Figure 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Fortunately, other core components should see modest relief. Nonfood goods inflation should ease to 0.56%m/m, sa from 0.77% in February, while sendees inflation moderates to 0.33%m/m, sa. However, in both cases it is not clear whether the moderation will be sustained. Nonfood goods prices could reaccelerate if supply constraints bind amid geopolitical tensions and CO VID-19-related production stoppages. Meanwhile, sendees inflation benefited from a drop in telecom prices, which as of now we think should be a one-off rather than a sustained trend. Thus, we think inflation pressures re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">main firmly in place, and the balance of risks points to their continuation. Regardless of the shifting sources of price pressures, the bottom line is that the persistent aggregate increases in prices could continue to push up inflation expectations. Adding insult to injury, non-core prices should also rise markedly on increases in energy and food prices in March. On an unadjusted basis, we forecast headline inflation at 0.98%m/m and 7.44%oya, with core inflation at 0.67%m/m and 6.74%oya.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Very robust February trade data</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Prior to the release of the February trade data., we signaled upside risks to our 3.5%q/q, saar GDP growth forecast for IQ. Strong auto production, broad-based strength in February survey data, and, particularly, in sendee-sector indicators accounted for such risks. We looked for reinforcement of those risks in this week’s trade report and got it, with the data showing a sharp increase in both external demand and indicators related to domestic spending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manufacturing exports surged nearly 17%m/m and are tracking a roughly 30% ar gain in IQ. We had looked for a reversal of January’s drop and expected factory exports to jump 6.2% in February. There had been increasing signs of recovery in factory output even prior to the trade report, particularly in the auto sector, pointing to signs of easing constraints from supply disruptions. The February data—prior to renewed COVID-19 concerns that could put supply chain disruptions back in the forefront—further stressed this point. Auto exports surged almost 35%m/m, but non-auto exports also rose at a rapid 9.3% rate. Altogether, factory exports jumped 16.7%m/m. Alongside a roughly 26% gain in auto production and solid US manufacturing data for the month, today’s report points to a large gain in domestic factory output in the month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">News on domestic demand also was upbeat, with non-oil consumer goods and capital imports rising in the month. In particular, consumer imports increased 6.2%m/m after 2.4%m/m average increases in the five months through January, consistent with these imports tracking a 44% annualized gain in</span></p>
