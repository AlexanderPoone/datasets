<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The good - The Central Bank of Nigeria has remained profitable. </span><span class="font4">Last week, the CBN released its financial accounts after several years of hiatus. It showed that the central bank remained profitable and has apositive net assets (equity ) position as of end-2022. Total assets have recorded significant growth over the past few years, up to NGN57.9tr (US$ 129.4bn), from NGN15.5bn (US$78.7bn) in 2015. This was largely driven by significant fiscal financing of the government for which total claims on government rose to NGN30.1 tr as at March 2023, from just NGN2.7tr in 2015. It is noteworthy that the government has concluded the re-profiling and restructuring of the bulk of the said overdrafts, reducing the interest rates to 9% (from policy rate + 30 Obp previously), three-year moratorium on principal repayments and a 40-year maturity extension. The new instrument is likely to remain on the CBN’s balance sheet. However, the CBN’s short-term FX liabilities and obligations were the most talked about post the release and the main catalyst for the market sell-off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The bad - Net FX reserves are significantly lower than previously estimated. </span><span class="font4">Based on partial information from the audited financial accounts, we estimate that CBN’s net FX reserves were around US$3.7bn at the end of last year, from US$14.Obn at end-2021. In arriving at said estimate we make a few assumptions which if incorrect would substantially change the picture. They include: (i)anadditionofUS$5.0bninIMF Special Drawing Rights (SDR) to external reserves in order to arrive at total gross FX reserves ofU S$3 7. Sbn, broadly in line with the 30-day moving average of US$37.08bn previously published on the central bank’s website; (ii) adjusting the gross external reserves with three key FX liability lines that include FX forwards (US$6.84bn), securities lending (US$5.5bn) and currency swaps (US $21.3bn); and (iii) estimating currency swaps by backing out FX forwards and outstanding OTC Futures balances from an overall aggregate published in the financial accounts (fine G in Table 2 below).</span></p>
