<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Financing risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The company’s rate of growth depends on its ability to raise capital from third-party investors to fund investment in the rooftop solar systems and storage that support the provision of Sunrun customer service, so disruption to the capital markets could slow the firm’s growth prospects relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Competition</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sunrun faces head-on competition from other national residential solar sen-ice companies and a host of regional and local companies. In the future, more utilities may also look to add residential solar systems in unregulated markets, competing with Sunrun. As the market matures, competition for customers could lead to depressed pncmg and diminishing returns on investments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Key personnel risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Loss of key executives could lead to execution challenges and weakening of relationships with the dealer network.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Policy and regulatory risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Federal, state, and local authorities are positioned to terminate or retroactively reverse tax credits, renewable energy credits, and other incentives or impose charges on rooftop solar customers who want to connect to the grid, which could impede growth relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Credit risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In adverse economic circumstances, it is possible that Sunrun’s customers could be late in paying their electricity bills or stop paying altogether, weighing on cash flow from operations relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Costs could increase</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Solar equipment costs, EPC costs, rising interest rates could lead to higher system costs, which could slow adoption relative to expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Interest rate risk</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUN’s calculated “net earning assets” metric is a net present value of the company’s cumulative systems deployed. A change in interest rates may cause investors to assign a higher discount rate in their NPV calculation, leading to lower valuations.</span></p>
