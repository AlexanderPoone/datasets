<h5><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Executive Summary</span></h5>
<p><span class="font2">Uplift in financial markets towards the end of 4Q23 and higher EOP and average AUM relative to prior forecasts drives near-term upwards earnings revisions. We revise Longterm AUM Levels +5.3% higher on average for 4Q23e and +5.8% higher for 2024e as a result of higher equity market indices with S&amp;P 500 +11.7% and MSCI World +10% for the quarter. This Leads us to revise net revenue expectations+7.7%/3.5% higher for '24/'25, and our EBITDA estimates are up +10%/6.6% on avg in '24/25. Flows are still muted as we see annualized organic decay of -2.8% in 4Q, which reflects a deterioration from -1.3% ann in 3Q on avg (excL WT). Into the 4Q print, flows are Largely de-risked as most mgrs have already reported AUM and flows for the quarter (see our Dec monthly AUM notes here and here). For 2024e however, we Look for organic growth of 0.4% on average (an improvement from -0.3% in 2O23e), accelerating to +1.1% in 2O25e as the market settles and investors move money back into risk assets from cash. Asset managers who best position themselves to capture money in motion once it comes off the sidelines could experience upwards revisions in forward year earnings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">While we retain our cautious stance on the traditional asset mgrs given structural challenges, we have selectively added risk (recently adding BLK to to Top Pick) given greater prospects for a soft Landing and improved macro outlook that can support flows and fund NAVs. Market volatility along with structural challenges is driving firms to revisit the cost base in search of greater efficiencies. We see a number of firms already announcing re-organization to drive cost saves. Expense initiatives to reduce fixed/variable operating costs and reorganization to realize structural efficiencies are among what mgmt teams can control to support margins but also free-up resources for investment toward growth initiatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This leads to our selective preference for Top Pick BLK (OW). We see BLK as best positioned to capture flows into fixed income and continue to deliver positive organic growth given exposure to attractive opportunities across fixed income, thematics/impact, alternatives, and ETFs. Coming out of 4Q23 Earnings (see our takeaways here), with their newly announced transformational acquisition of GIP as well as their recently announced structural reorganization to prioritize investment in areas of growth and positioning ahead of secular trends (i.e. infrastructure and the ETF revolution), we see BLK as having the ability to successfully navigate through a volatile macro backdrop, take share and deliver organic growth, harness Aladdin tech capabilities to unlock growth, and act strategically from a position of strength. Our $1,000 PT offers 27% upside, and reflects a 2x premium vs the S&amp;P ~18x P/E on '25, which we feel as warranted given expectations for double digits earnings growth (~15% CAGR across '23-'25) and high quality compounding franchise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4Q23 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Preview</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Earnings kicked off for the traditional asset mgrs with BLK on January 12 and next up is IVZ on January 23rd. Into the 4Q print, we focus on 1) organic growth trends as investors begin to re-risk and move money out of cash and into risk assets 2) outlook and ability to execute on expense efficiency initiatives to better protect operating margins and free up resources for growth initiatives, and 3) capital management priorities (including strategic M&amp;A, debt paydown and capital return). We're Listening for color</span></p>
