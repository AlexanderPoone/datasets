It’s worth noting that Signify does not conduct m-home healthcare themselves; they are simply connecting providers to the patients and collecting data to inform their care management. In Feb 2022, SGFY announced the acquisition of Caravan Health, which enables ACOs in the transition to value based care through a tech enabled platform. Caravan is expected to achieve ~$40M of revenue in 2022 with 25% EBITDA margins.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CVS remains a top idea. </span><span class="font3">CVS’s goal to be a vertically aligned, all-payor primary care delivery platform. To that goal, we believe that SGFY adds to those capabilities as the company looks to advance its VBC and primary care capabilities through primary care centers, while mtegrating virtual and home assets and MSO capabilities. The company is interested in building capabilities that can span the consumer, employer and government channels, and is looking for busmesses with a strong tech stack, strong management experience and a path to profitability. We believe the SGFY acquisition is the first of multiple acquisition/investments to attain their goal. We continue to highlight the company’s very strong cash flows and capital flexibility.</span></p></li></ul>
