<p><span class="font4">52.6% 31.1% (35.4% ex-com), 25.2% (46.1% ex-com), 48.1%, 52.7%, 53.2%, 48.6%, and 41.0% in 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018,2017, 2016, 2015,2014, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">More specifically, senior secured bonds are recovering 76.8% on an LTM basis, compared with their long-term average recovery of 53.0%, </span><span class="font4">and is at a high since 2007, while senior unsecured bonds have recovered 48.0%, which is above the long-term average of 35.7%. As for leveraged loans, recoveries are now well above 2020’s record low, although below their historical averages. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">For example, LTM recovery rates for first-liens are now 61.1% compared with 55.7% in 2021, 48.3% in 2020, 49.0% in 2019,63.4% in 2018, 57.5% in 2017, 62.7% in 2016, 48.2% in 2015, and their 24-year annual average of 64.4%. </span><span class="font4">As for second hen loans, recoveries are 42.7% over the last twelve months, compared with their long-term annual average of 22.4%. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">That said recovery rates for first-lien loan-only issuers over the past 12 months (50.5%) are well below those for loan and bond issuers (85.0%). Note that 9 of the 13 issuer recovery rates used are loan-only. </span><span class="font4">Also note that loan-only recovery rates were also depressed in 2021 (44.3%, 5 issuers), 2020 (41.7%, 34 issuers), 2019 (46.3%, 14 issuers), 2018 (47.7%, 5 issuers) and 2017 (54.2%, 11 issuers). Notably, there is historical precedence for lower recovery rates in loan-only versus the cross issuer base. </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Since 2008, the avg. recovery on 214 loan only defaults is 50% vs 64% for 140 L&amp;B defaults. While it is expected bond recovery rates will remain above the long-term average given the dearth of distressed supply and improved commodities backdrop, loan recovery rates will probably languish versus historical in a downturn given three out of four issuers are now loan-only.</span></p></li></ul>
