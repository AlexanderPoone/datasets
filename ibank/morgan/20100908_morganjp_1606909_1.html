<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US$300m CB issue: </span><span class="font7">Shui On Land (SOL) proposed the issue of US$300 million (fixed at Rmb 2,040 million) Rmb-denominated CB due 2015 (at par) with an upsize option of US$100 million. The coupon rate is 4.5% and conversion price is HKS4.87. representing 36.4% premium of yesterday price close (HK$3.57). The currency conversion rate is fixed at Rmbl = HK$ 1.1439. There is a put option by CB holders by Sep 2013. Upon full conversion, a total of 638.9 million shares would be issued, or 12.4% of the existing issued share capital.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;53% NAV dilution: </span><span class="font7">The conversion price represents 28% discount to Dec-10 clean-site NAV of HK$6.76/sh. Also, SOL's BVPS was HK$5.02 as of Jun-10. Hence the full conversion would lead to a 5.3% NAV dilution to HK$6.4 and 3% dilution to book value to HKS4.85.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proceeds to be used for developments: </span><span class="font7">As of end Jun-10, SOL had a net gearing of 32% with Rmb5 billion cash-on-hand, while the shortterm debt (mature in 1 year) only amounted to Rmb 1.5 billion. Hence we believe the CB net proceeds of Rmb 1,962 million (assume no upsizing) will be largely used for the relocation and speeding up of construction. SOL needs to spend Rmb 10.2 billion in FY10 while we forecast the presale proceeds and rental income would be only Rmb5.1 billion this year. Added to this is that SOL is trying to speed up relocation and hence may need more funding. The offshore bond proceeds should help SOL achieve its 1 million sqm delivery target by FY12.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cap at HK$4.87? </span><span class="font7">It is worth noting that SOL's previous (HK$2 billion) equity raising in Jun-09 was placed at HK$4.87 as well. Chairman Lo, now holding 50.65% in SOL, could potentially be diluted to 45.07%. It appears that the major shareholder is willing to hold below 50% stake when share price is close to CB conversion price (which is almost on parity to current book value). While we see the impact of CB on SOL’s financials and share price is largely neutral, we expect the issue could place a medium-term cap on the share price performance.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment we see limited positive share price catalysts unless SOL's contract sales in the next 4 months can well exceed analysts' contract sales expectations. We expect SOL to achieve Rmb3 billion sales on top of Rmb 1.47 billion achieved in 1H10.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have a Neutral rating and Jun-11 PT of </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">HK$3.80 </span><span class="font7">based on 45% discount to NAV, which is the long-term average discount. Our NAV is based on assumptions of 6.5-9.5% cap rate and 5-15% housing price decline in FY10E. We see limited upside at current share price levels. Downside risks to our PT are the swings in property prices in Shanghai. Key upside risk is asset value growth in Tier-2 cities where SOL has large exposure (both residential and commercial).</span></p>
