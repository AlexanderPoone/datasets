<p><span class="font2">Economic and policy outlooks: The AUD cycle has staying power, resulting in a more stable curve than others in DM</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Australian economy proved broadly resilient in the face of shocks, and higher interest rates in 2023. Having entered the year with inflation at a 30-year high, resilient growth can only be consistent with progress toward central bank goals if the supply side is strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">That </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">prox ed to be the case</span><span class="font3">, and it remains plausible that inflation could be brought u nder control without very difficult adjustments. Population growth is supporting aggregate output, as per-capita spending slows (Figure 1). Policy transmission via the cashflow channel is also more precise in Australia than elsewhere, thanks to the largely variable-rate mortgage structure, giving the RBAgreater certainty over financial conditions and so avoiding an over-tightening scenario.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">There are still policy lags to play out, particularly in the labour market. Though we also see some offsets to higher unemployment which will support real output, including easing inflation, and tax cuts. In 2024, our forecast is for GDP growth of 2.1%y/y for the calendar year and 2.5%oya on a Q4/Q4 basis. This compares to a tracking estimate of 1.9%y/y for 2023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Markets have eventually acknowledged that Australia's policy cycle may differ to that in the US. This is the central difference to earlier in the cycle, where the RBA was assumed to hike more than the Fed, even by the end of 2022. The market is now pricing close to our policy rate forecast for 2024 (Figure 2) i.e. a high-hold scenario through the year, with relatively greater prospect of cuts in the US and NZ. The assumed stability suggests markets see the RBA’s policy approach as broadly credible. As noted in research this year, the AUD curve has been highly ‘suggestible’ in 2023, as policy surprises have induced parallel curve shifts relatively often (see Figure 3, and here). A similar theme is evident in the 3Y bond futures, in the sense that open interest hasn’t yet lifted with the slight easing in rate volatility (Figure 4).</span></p>
