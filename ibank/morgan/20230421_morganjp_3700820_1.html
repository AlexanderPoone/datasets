<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inflation pressure persists: 1.1% saqr for IQ ECI, 0.33% for April core PCE inflation (both 4.7%oya)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">A key early look at 2Q activity, in the form of the April flash PMIs, pointed to greater-than-expected momentum into 2Q. There were sizable, broad-based upside surprises throughout both the manufacturing and sendees PMI reports for this month. While it is clearly too early to draw any Ann conclusions (and the volatile regional surveys this week offered mixed messages), the nature and extent of the move higher are an encouraging signal for growth—but potentially less so for the Fed, which is looking for the economy to cool. The fact that the PMI price measures also moved up also leans in the direction of additional concern for the Fed. Housing starts perked up in March and homebuilder sentiment continued to move up in April as well. Countering those signs of strength into the current quarter is the continued drift up in initial jobless claims, which offer a clearer sign of a cooling labor market.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Given these developments we still expect a 25bp hike at the next FOMC meeting. Remarks by various Fed officials this week reiterated the commitment to fight inflation and the need to tighten the policy stance a touch more. Some members of the FOMC started expressing more emphasis on being cautious lately, but the outcome for the May meeting seems not to be a main point of disagreement. Additionally, the Fed’s Beige Book highlighted tightening credit conditions and lower loan demand in some districts following the banking sector stress last month. Going forward, we’ll want to watch how much the hard data will be impacted by these factors.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Housing might be stabilizing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">A range of housing market releases this week were mixed but broadly consistent with further stabilization in the sector. Residential construction activity in the single-family segment, which had been slowing sharply since the beginning of the monetary policy tightening, started to show some signs of stabilization. Single-family starts rose 2.7% in March, the second monthly gain in a row (Figure 1). Overall housing starts slipped slightly to 1.420mn from a downward revised 1.432mn in February as the smaller but more volatile multifamily segment posted a larger decline. Permits, a sign of near-term activity, registered a larger decline to 1.413mn annual units from an upwardly revised 1.550mn the month prior. Once again the significant decline in March was driven</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">by the weakness in the multi-family segment; single-family permits rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Following a 13.8% surge in activity in February, existing home sales gave back a little of that gain and declined 2.4% in March (Figure 2). The outlook for the interest-sensitive housing sector is tightly related to the policy environment. Overall, existing home sales are down 22% over the past year, highlighting the continuing challenges the residential sector faces from sharply tighter monetary policy over that same period.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Manufacturing activity decidedly mixed</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The suiprise 2.6pt jump in the April flash manufacturing PMI interrupts what had been a material downward trend in both this survey and the manufacturing ISM. Similarly mixed messages arose from regional manufacturing surveys this week (Figure 3). The NY Fed’s Empire State manufacturing survey surprised significantly to the upside, with the headline general business conditions index jumping to 10.8 from -24.6 in Marell, well above both consensus and our own (above-consensus) forecasts. This was the first positive reading in five months. Among the Empire State components, new orders and shipments both rose sharply from fairly depressed levels—the former reaching a 12-mo nth high. That said, this survey has been quite volatile post-pandemic, with large swings in either direct of the underlying diffusion index.</span></p>
