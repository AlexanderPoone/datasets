<p><span class="font5">What’s more, the economy’s underlying structure evolves in ways that alter these linkages over time. It is thus no surprise that policymakers are genuinely cautious in making statements about where the neutral rates lies at any specific juncture. Indeed, history shows that both the average level of US real policy rates and the peak reached before recession has varied widely over the past six decades (Figure 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">An estimate of neutral is, however, a necessary input for monetary policy decisions and there is broad agreement that neutral rates have fallen sharply over the past decade. Indeed, when the FOMC began publishing long-term interest rate forecasts in its survey of economic projections (SEP) in 2012 it estimated US nominal neutral policy rates at 4.25% (Figure 3). At present, the Fed’s SEP estimates the nominal long-term policy rate at 2.5%. While this estimate does not map precisely into the assessment of the current stance, the implied r* of 0.5% in this forecast is an indication that the Fed sees neutral real rates sitting close to zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">While there are no consistent time series estimates of neutral policy rate forecasts produced by DM central banks, our economists’ projections reinforce the general point that estimates are low. For the DM, our economists estimate average neutral real rates at 0.2%. The Fed rate is forecasted at 0.25% while estimates are zero for the Euro area. Real neutral rates are projected to be negative for Scandinavia and the Antipo-</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">The view that real neutral rates have fallen sharply has been reinforced by a wide range of econometric work that estimates long term neutral rates (r*). Most of the recent work in this area jumps off Laubach and Williams analysis, inferring r* from movements in the output gap. These models simultaneously estimate the output gap and r* by incorporating a Phillips curve relationship, which links output gaps to realized inflation. Although these r* models vary in their complexity, they ultimately rely on the existence of a stable Philips curve relationship to tie down both the neutral rate and the output gap.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Against this backdrop, it is relatively easy to understand the dominant driver of the fall in r* estimates over the last decade. Although several structural forces are highlighted -including weakening demographics, sliding productivity, and an EM savings glut - declining r* estimates (and by extension neutral policy rates) are closely linked to the persistence of low inflation in the face of nominal policy rates remaining close to zero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">There is every reason to see the post-GFC period of persistent low inflation as evidence that the low-for-long stances maintained by central banks did not generate a sufficient reflation-aiy impulse. However, given the enormous shock-waves generated by the GFC it is harder to assess the permanence of this shift. Indeed, the GFC shock unleashed a lengthy period of balance sheet adjustment and regulatory change which limited the private sector response to accommodative monetary policy. In addition, DM fiscal policy tightened substantially from 2011 -15, a development which was accompanied a recession and crisis in the Euro area (Figure 4). Any consideration of neutral rates going forward needs to assess the degree to which the disinflationary backdrop of the post-GFC expansion carries forward into the post-pandemic recovery.</span></p>
