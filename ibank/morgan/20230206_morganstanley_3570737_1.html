<p><span class="font6">Morgan Stanley FX Positioning</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Tracker</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Strong US data Led to a USD short squeeze on Friday, with positioning reducing sharply from -36% of opening interest to back to neutral a round -6%. Tactical investors have been quick to cut short USD exposure in the options market, but continued USD strength this week remains a risk as longer-term investors are still short USD and the market may price in additional tightening by the Fed ahead. EM currencies look more vulnerable as longs persist, particularly in Asia and CEE. In GIO, there are no clear stand-out longs anymore, with NOK, SEK and GBP the key underweights. We see scope for EUR/JPY and EUR/GBP longs to continue building a mid economic a nd monetary policy divergence, while the rally in EUR/NOKand EUR/SEK looks overdone and positioning stretched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Options market positioning</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Strong data squeeze out USD shorts: </span><span class="font1">Investors rushed to exit short USD positions in size on Friday as an extraordinarily strong US labour market report -coupled also with upside surprises in the services and JOLTS prints - led to a quick re-evaluation of the short-term inflation, Fed and USD outlook. Aggregate USD positioning reduced rapidly from -36% of open interest on Thursday to back to neutral levels around -6% by Friday close (Exhibit 1). We don't think this will prevent another rally in USD this week as longer-term investors are also short USD and the market may price in a hawkish response by the Fed. We have removed our short USD recommendations and turned tactically neutral on USD into the next US CPI release. In G10, AUD, NZD and GBP saw the largest unwinds - in part due to more elevated long positioning EUR was more resilient as riskpositive carry trades got unwound and signals of further ECB tightening ahead kept EU-rest of world rate differentials elevated. Tactical investors are not long any G10 currency vis-a-vis USD in the options market anymore, with GBP, NOK and SEK now the largest shorts. In EM, unwinds were mostly concentrated in high-beta, risk-sensitive currencies like MXN, ZAR, BRL. Long EM positions persist though, with Asia (IDR, PHP, KRW) and CEE currencies (vs EUR) now Looking more owned than LatAm (Exhibit 2).</span></p>
