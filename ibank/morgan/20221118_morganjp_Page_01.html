<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High-yield bond spreads tightened lObp over the past week and yields are 83bp below October’s high amid easing inflation concerns, limited supply ($400mn), better-than-feared earnings, and the largest stretch of retail inflows on record aside from the stretch surrounding the pandemic. </span><span class="font6">In particular, the past 4 weeks’ $11.3bn of inflows are exceeded only by the $48bn of inflows over a 12-week stretch between April and June 2020. Meanwhile, 3Q HY Earnings in aggregate were better-than-feared </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">(link)</span><span class="font6">, and guidance improved from 2Q22 levels. On the other hand, dispersion among sectors is rapidly rising. High-yield bond yields and spreads decreased 7bp and lObp over the past week to 9.07% and 500bp, respectively. There was also mild outperformance down in quality after experiencing significant decompression among ratings over the previous 2 weeks. As well, the BB/BBB relationship has widened 40%+ off the multi-year extreme in late October from 93bp to 135bp or 16bp inside the past years’ average. The US HY index is now down -10.8% year-to-date with Single B bonds (-9.6%) outperforming BB bonds by 50bp (-10.1%) and CCC bonds by 943bp (-19.0%).</span></p>

<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;November’s rally in leveraged loan prices slowed this week (+S0.05 w/w) amid a focus on earnings and the most active primary market since early June ($8bn). </span><span class="font6">For context, November’s loan volume totaling $14.8bn is a high since June and leaves year-to-date volumes of $226bn down 71% yoy. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The Leveraged Loan index is providing a +1.17% gain in November with B (+1.53%) outperforming BB (+1.13%) and CCC (-0.34%) performance. </span><span class="font6">Year-to-date, the Leveraged Loan index is providing a -0.57% loss with BB (+2.2%) and B loans (-1.2%) outperforming CCC loans (-13.0%). BB, B1/B2, B3, and CCC loans now have a spread to maturity of 340bp, 551 bp, 793bp, and 1772bp, respectively. Note the B1/B2 spread versus BB loans of 210bp is now comfortably above the past 12Ms average of 152bp following higher quality loans’ 4Q outperformance. As well, CCC loans now trade 979bp wide of B3 loans and are pricing in a recession. Given we expect a downgrade wave and build in the CCC loan universe over the next year, the current cohort of B3 loans should underperform amid hindered demand conditions. Note ahead of Veteran’s Day we published the latest </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">High-Yield Bond and Institutional Loan Maturity Schedule</span><span class="font6">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The historic upgrade wave for HY bond issuers has waned. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October included the most downgraded bond issuers (26) and the fewest # of upgrades (14) since late 2020. October was the also the first month bond upgrades failed to exceed downgrades since December 2020. </span><span class="font6">By industry, Healthcare (22) and Tech (17) have produced the most downgrades YTD. The 2022 upgrade-to-downgrade ratio by number of bond issuers is still a favorable 1.69:1, which consists of ratios for BB, B, and CCC issuers of 2.88:1, 1.56:1, and 1.04:1, respectively. Meanwhile, ratings trends for loan issuers have been eroding since May. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">October’s # of loan issuers downgraded (34) exceeded upgrades (13) for a sixth consecutive month. </span><span class="font6">October also included the fewest issuers upgraded and most issuers downgraded May 2020. Healthcare (42), Consumer Products (31), and Technology (29) have produced the most downgrades. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">The 2022 upgrade-to-downgrade ratio for loans stands at 0.77:1 versus 1.69:1 for bonds.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our US economist Michael Feroh published </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">2023 US Economic Outlook: Bad Moon Rising</span><span class="font6">. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Avoiding a near-term recession, our economists now expect an additional lOObp of Fed rate hikes (50bp Dec, 25bp Feb, 25bp Mar) and forecast a mild US recession by 4Q23 amid a million job losses (unemployment rate rises from 3.6% to 5.0% in 2024). </span><span class="font6">In the details, they expect annualized quarterly core CPI rates to cool from 5.5% in 2H22 to 3.7% in 1H23 and 2.9% in 2H23. And forecasted US GDP growth is +1.0% in +1Q23, +0.8% in 2Q23, +0.5% in 3Q23, and -0.5% by 4Q23 (or +0.4% q4/4 2023 GDP growth). Our economists’ base case sees the Fed easing 50bp per quarter from 2Q24 to reach 3.5% by YE24. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Note we will publish our 2023 High-Yield Bond and Leveraged Loan Outlook early next week.</span></p></li></ul>
