<p><span class="font4">Departing Premier Li Keqiang delivered the government work report to the NPC on 5 March. The annual growth target is set at “around 5%” (vs. our forecast of “above 5%”), which seems relatively conservative at first sight. The annual growth target is pre-determined, usually at the Central Economic Work Conference in December, so in this case likely before China’s reopening. Also, the annual growth target is no longer a binding constraint, and 2023 is different from 2021, with a more challenging external environment. The fiscal deficit target is 3% of GDP (3.88 trillion yuan), in line with our expectations, with the special LGB quota at 3.8 trillion yuan. Our estimate of augmented fiscal deficit in 2023 is 11.5% of GDP, or lower than 2022 by 1.2% of GDP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The government work report only repeated that “prudent monetary policy should be targeted and forceful.” We highlight major takeaways from the the press conference hosted by PBOC senior officials on 3 March. The PBOC’s concerns about rising inflation have been toned down, and the narrative signals that the PBOC may keep policy rates unchanged throughout 2023. Preventing financial risks remains an important task for the PBOC and regulators.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Institutional reform plan for State Council</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The State Council released the institutional reform plan, which will be reviewed by the NPC on 10 March, while the institutional reform plan for the Party has not yet been disclosed. The government will reorganize the Ministry of Science and Technology. The State Administration of Financial Supervision and Administration will be established to replace the China Banking &amp;&nbsp;Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC). This new agency will take charge of all financial regulatory and supervisory issues, other than the securities industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The institutional reform plan of the State Council aims to strengthen government functions in several important areas. One area is to promote technology innovations and industry upgrade. This is not only important for China’s ambition for</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">high-quality growth, but also critical when facing increasing external challenges, especially technology decoupling from the U.S. and a restructuring of the global supply chain. The second area is to improve financial regulation and supervision and prevent systemic risk, e.g., spillover risk from housing market corrections, local government hidden debt, regional banks and financial irregularities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It will be worth watching whether the Central Financial Work Conference (which is held every five years, and the current conference was postponed from last year) to be held later this year will follow up further on financial regulatory reform. Others include digital economy and rural areas development.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Solid export recovery in January-February</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">China’s January-February exports fell 6.8%oya, with an average rise of 4.6% m/m sa compared to the December level. Imports fell 10.2%oya on a l/2%m/m average gain. Breakdown details highlight a significant rebound in tech exports (with an average increase of 13.9% m/m sa in January-February), including mobile phone exports (with an average increase of 30.2% m/m sa), reflecting a normalization of tech supply chain activity upon reopening, consistent with the latest signals from other major North Asian exporters (Figure 1). Meanwhile, exports of lower-end consumer goods remained on the soft side, with an average decline of 3.3% m/m sa in January-Februaiy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Reopening, supply chain normalization and near-term resilient DM demand conditions appear to have supported a decent post-COVID-19 recoveiy in China’s exports sector. Further out, external demand uncertainty may resume later in the year as major central banks deliver further monetary policy tightening. In addition, ongoing supply chain relocation and geopolitical tensions may drag China’s export sector recovery beyond the post-COVID-19 rebound. Together with a widening service trade deficit amid the re-opening of cross-border travel, we expect net exports’ contribution to China’s overall GDP growth to turn negative (-0.5%-pt) in 2023.</span></p>
