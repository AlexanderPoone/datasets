<p><span class="font5">In our December publication </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">(here)</span><span class="font5">, we turned outright negative on global equities. The recent weakening of economic data (e.g. ISM, industrial production, regional surveys, retail sales, etc.) and anticipated decline in earnings expectations are pointing to markets that are likely to move lower in our view. Economic slowdown and weakening corporate fundamentals are happening in an environment where interest rates are very high (Fed Funds is at its highest level since 2007), rising, and likely to stay high as stated by the Fed on several occasions. Whether the terminal rate is higher or lower by a few hikes at this point does not matter in our view, given the absolute level of rates and shock that was introduced to the system in the second half last year. Layoffs are starting to happen, and, given margin pressures, they are likely to accelerate. In the backdrop of these negative developments, markets have been fairly resilient and, in many segments, moved significantly higher this year. Does that mean that recession was priced in, positioning was sufficiently low, or something else?</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">Before we address the question of recession, we note that indeed recent flows have been positive - primarily driven by systematic inflows on account of declining volatility (e.g. VIX sub-20). Volatility significantly declined in December, helped by low trading activity and hedging of long option positions (such as put spread collars and short calls). In Europe, likely misplaced optimism caused trend following programs to reverse positions from fully short to long. Along the way, many fundamental investors also covered their short positions, despite their negative fundamental outlook. Also, there is a January effect of new 401(k) allocations, rotation from growth to value, as well as increased risk positions by long only funds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">However, we think all of those drivers are running out of steam, and markets that are heading towards recession are being further aggravated by central bank tightening. We think that recession is currently not priced in equity markets. We do not agree with the argument that because a recession is consensus (although more and more believe in soft landing), the market and economic outcome have to be better (e.g. one out of consensus scenario is a much more severe recession, or one that strikes much sooner than consensus expects). Figure 1 below shows the performance of various equity market segments over the past year. US industrials, and non-tech large caps (Dow Jones) as well as European stocks are basically flat over the past year, and close to previous highs. After a -20% rally since last fall, this would strongly suggest that a recession is currently not priced in. Keep in mind that over that year we had unprecedented global monetary tightening, energy crisis, inflation crisis, geopolitical crises, decline in earnings and significant increase of recession probability. Europe is particularly puzzling as it is trading as if the energy crisis, war and geopolitical crisis (which is likely to escalate in our view), and sharp monetary tightening did not happen at all.</span></p>
