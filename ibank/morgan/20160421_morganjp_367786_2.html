<p><span class="font4">strategy in its infancy (we found out in March 2016 and so far this still in a conceptual stage with minimal investment spent) and mimics the lessomall model used in China. One disadvantage, in our view, is that Lesso must buy or lease new large warehouse exhibition centers overseas that may cost more than in China (located in its existing pipe factory facilities). We believe investors would perceive this new global push as more of a risk than a reward in the early stages and we need to monitor if the cash commitment by Lesso is very material in order to assess the risk to the company (we don't know a reliable budget for spending on GD Home yet).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Findings from recent visits to other construction related companies:</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Construction activity may be heating up. </span><span class="font4">Our recent visit to a construction site by China State Construction (3311 HK -OW) in the city of Jiaxing in Eastern China revealed that there has been a significant increase in the cost of some construction materials since 4Q15 as construction activity heated up after the CNY holiday. In addition, wage growth for construction is also higher than 10 percent Y Y and in some cases much higher. This indicates a still tight market for certain types of labour. It is encouraging to see a faster pace of both private and public construction in the Yangtze delta region. We heard from CSC management that construction is improving in the area around Jiaxing; this is consistent with some favourable figures on new home construction released by the government (see below). If these improvements hold up (over very low numbers in 2015), then we should see sentiment improve not only for CSC but for other construction material and related companies such as SMID - Caps under coverage (Xinyi Glass, China Lesso, Haitian , Kingboard Chern, Sky worth , etc)</span></p>

<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">General pick-up in sentiment from factories. </span><span class="font4">Our recent visit to Haitian Inti, the largest plastic injection molding machinery maker globally, suggests a widespread recovery in demand that is causing many plastic parts makers to order new machinery. Incidentally, Lesso is one of the largest customers of Haitian. Haitian is seeing a more robust order flow after the CNY holidays and is running near capacity now to deliver machinery from strong March order flow. The company cited a general improvement in end user demand for plastic pails as well as government policies (such as tax rebates and subsidies) that encourage factories to update their equipment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Price, valuation and risks. </span><span class="font4">Our PT (Dec-16. DCF-derived) of HK$9.0 implies a fwd P/BV of 1.69x and P/E of 8.46x (CY17E). The key downside risks include lower non-PVC prices, higher wages and lower margins on non-PVC pipes and non-pipe products, significant increase in R&amp;D costs and a sharp fall in housing construction starts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Please refer to our latest note, </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">&quot;‘China Lesso (2128 HK): Lowering PT to HK$9 - modest growth in a tough market''</span><span class="font4"> dated</span></p>
