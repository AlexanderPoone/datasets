<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Update with digital broker Convoy. </span><span class="font1">We spoke with President &amp;&nbsp;COO Mark Okerstrom as part of our focus on freight tech at the conference. With a network of over 350k Class 8 trucks in the U.S., Convoy is able to guarantee capacity and is being viewed as more of a strategic capacity provider than a “digital broker” per Okerstrom. Convoy believes the industry is in the early stages of automation and recently launched Convoy for Brokers that offers capacity and toolkits to other brokers.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A budding freight tech market with varying approaches. </span><span class="font1">We hosted an Autonomous Trucking Panel with Don Burnette, CEO and Co-founder of Kodiak Robotics, and Finch Fulton, VP of Policy and Strategy at Locomation. The autonomous trucking industry is still in the early stages with multiple entrants and several different approaches, but the technology presents a significant opportunity to lower freight costs, improve safety, and expand capacity. Autonomous trucking developers are all increasingly focused on proving their safety case which will be critical as they look to gain operating experience in the real-world. We don’t believe there will be one winner in this industry given the significant size of the potential market.</span></p>
