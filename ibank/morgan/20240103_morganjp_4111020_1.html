This followed a recovery of 8.9%q q, saar, in 2Q and 11.1% in 3Q after a contraction in IQ. The strength in 4Q was broadbased, with industrial and sendees production increasing by 15.0% and 11.5%, respectively.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strong exports buoyed the manufacturing sector. Real exports reversed their year-to-date growth to positive 8.7% in 4Q after remaining negativeuntil 3Q, stronger than customs exports (-4.4%oya,ytd) implied. Both techand non-tech exports showed robust growth in 4Q. The formerwas supported by the regional tech upswing in 2H, while the latter gained momentum in 4Q, with external resilience lasting longer than anticipated, especially in the US (a key export destination). In the near term, we anticipate that real exports in GDP might see some corrections. However, the global demand slowdown is projected to be gradual (with the likelihood of a soft landing increasing after the Fed’s dovish pivot), making it unlikely to disrupt Vietnam’s trend-like growth this year.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The domestic-oriented services sector expanded by 11.5%q/q, saar, in 4Q, following strong growth of 9.7% in 2Q and 12.7% in 3Q. This accompanied larger positive contributions ofconsumption and investment to overall growth in 4Q from a quarter ago. While we thought that domestic demand growth would moderate after mid-year surges that had beenboosted by post-pandemic dynamics and monetary policy easing, itextended its robust expansion into 4Q. Investment growth accelerated in 4Q despite a quarterly correction in the construction sector, as strong exports might have fueled facility investment. Loo king forward, weanticipate that services should gradually revert to a trendlike mid-single-digit pace, after three consecutive quarters of 10-13%ar growth. The nearly flat growth in retail sales in December, down from 23.3% 3m/3m, saar, in September broadly aligns with this view.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">GDP growth maintained resilience in 4Q, longer than we had expected, both externally and domestically. That said, the details largely conformed to our expectation for normalization from the recent above-par sequential growth. Reflecting the 4Q outturns (5.0%y/y for Rill-year 2023 vs. JPMe 4.4%), we have revised up our 2024 growth forecast from 5.9% to 6.2%. With the caveat of high uncertainty in global growth assumptions, the regained domestic stability—after noise from the pandemic and local liquidity issues—supports our outlook for trend-like growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the inflation front, oil and food prices eased further in December afterpushing up headline CPI in 3Q. Prices for transport (motor fuel) fell 0.3%m/m, sa, in December for the third straight monthly drop, and food CPI reduced its increases from 0.8% in September to 0.4% in November and 0.2% in December. Core CPI exhibited a stable 0.2% rise in December following 0.1% in Octoberand 0.2% in November. Core’s year-ago inflation continued to moderate from 5.2%oya in January to 3.0% in December. Given the diminishing supply-side volatility, we maintain our view that core’s gradual stabilization should determine the overall inflation path this year.
