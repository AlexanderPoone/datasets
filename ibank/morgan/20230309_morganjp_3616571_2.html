<p><span class="font1">- 5.4% ex-Financials). Interestingly, median net income growth remains positive at 4.1% (vs. 4.2% in 3Q22). One explanation for the gap between the earnings growth values could be the lapping of strong 4Q21 prints, which weighed on the overall index this quarter especially among some of the largest earnings contributors (e.g. AMZN, GOOGL, META, AAPL, INTO). As it relates to concerns around an earnings recession, ex-Energy this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter of negative earnings growth (i.e. 4Q22: -10.8%, 3Q22: -5.5%, 2Q22: -5.5%).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Margins. </span><span class="font1">Net income margins surprised to the downside by roughly -40bps. Overall, margins contracted -70bps q/q and - 170bps y/y to 11.5% on the quarter. Energy and Industrials are the only sectors to have experienced margin expansion over the past year(+350bps and + 160bps, respectively) though both saw margin compression on the quarter (-130bps and -10bps). Interestingly, Long Duration'Secular Growth (-250bps y/y) and Bond Proxies (-190bps) have been larger sources of margin compression than Cyclicals (-80bps) on the quarter. However, Cyclicals remain highly bifurcated with margin gains among Energy/Industrials mentioned above more than offset by margin compression within Financials (-360bps y/y), Materials (-270bps) and Discretionary (-240bps).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">S&amp;P 500 EPS Revisions. </span><span class="font1">Since the beginning of the earnings season (i.e., </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1/13), </span><span class="font1">4Q22E EPS have been revised down -0.7% to $53.30 (-1% y/y) with 2022E EPS revised down -0.3% to $218.75 (+5% y/y). Looking to 2023, EPS has already been revised down -2.9% since the beginning of the earnings season to $221.65 (+1% y/y). Tlie revision lower can be largely attributed to sharper revisions for 1H23 (i.e. 1Q23: -5.0%, 2Q23: -2.8%) compared to 2H23 (i.e. 3Q23: -1.7%, 4Q23: -1.0%). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">US Earnings Recession. </span><span class="font1">Based on current consensus estimates, analysts are forecasting S&amp;P 500 earnings to enter an earnings recession by the end of lQ23m, which is expected to last for another quarter (2Q23) before a mild earnings recovery in 3Q23 (see Figure 9). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2024 EPS Revisions. </span><span class="font1">The current 2024 EPS of $248.52 implies ~12% y/y growth (see Figure 8). However, this is likely a product of more aggressive cuts to the 2023 EPS consensus estimate (vs. 2024) and limited/shrinking corporate guidance beyond 2023 given elevated economic uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Performance Post-Earnings. </span><span class="font1">Aggregate average price performance relative to the market ID post-earnings was positive at +0.3% (median performance +0.4%, see Figure 12) and +0.1% for 5D-post earnings (median performance -0.3%). For the most part, average 1D performance post earnings saw a positive spread between the average performance of companies beatings versus missing. However, there were two exceptions to this trend, specifically Financials (-2.3% spread) which experienced positive performance after misses (+1.8%) while seeing beats sold (-0.5%) and Communications (-0.3% spread) which saw beats faded (-0.4%) more than outright misses (-0.1%).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ID Excess Performance. </span><span class="font1">For the most part, Cyclicals were rewarded strongly for beats, specifically Discretionary (+1.9%), Materials (+1.7%) and Industrials (+1.3%). On the other hand, more Defensive sectors such as Staples (-3.2%) and Healthcare (-3.1%) experienced the most underperformance for misses.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5D Excess Performance. </span><span class="font1">Among beats, Industrials largely held onto and further grew their post-earnings performance gains (ID: +1.3%, 5D: +1.8%). While Financials were not initially rewarded for beats ID after (-0.5%), they did end up outperforming the market 5Ds post earnings (+0.3%). Lastly, Communication names that beat were on average faded ID post-eamings (-0.4%), which then further accelerated after 5Ds post-eamings (-3.9%).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Buyback Announcements. </span><span class="font1">Buyback announcements currently stand at $261B YTD, the fastest pace on record for the same point in time in previous years (see Figure 17). Interestingly, over 70% of the buyback announcements are concentrated in just 5</span></p>
