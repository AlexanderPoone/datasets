<p><span class="font2">Led by stocks that benefit from the adoption of artificial intelligence, the S&amp;P 500 (+1.23%) rallied in the Latter half of the week to a new record high. Amid this more conducive backdrop for risk assets, the US dollar (DXY USD Index: -0.3%) waned into the NY afternoon, while risk-sensitive G10 currencies outpaced peers. Resoundingly strong preliminary January University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment at 78.8 (C: 70.1), coupled with a decline in 1y inflation expectations to 2.9% (C: 3.1%) - the lowest since December 2020 - dovetailed with the risk asset optimism. Hawkish interpretations of comments from Chicago Fed President Goolsbee sent front-end USTs (2y: 4.39%, +3.2bp) into the red, while a long-end (30y: 4.33%, -3.7bp) rally twist flattened the curve. Curve shape lacked a distinct trend over the week: bear-steepener (Tuesday), bear-flattener (Wednesday), twist-steepener (Thursday), and twist flattener (Friday).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Remarks from Fed Governor Waller were in the spotlight this week after he referenced prospective rate cuts in 2024 but cautioned the sustainability of recent trends in data require the path of policy &quot;to be carefully calibrated and not rushed.&quot; He compared the Fed's current disposition on rate cuts to prior cycles and said economic shocks which either threatened or caused a recession Led the Fed to cut rates reactiveLy, quickly, and often by large amounts. Waller believes a different starting point in this cycle - economic activity and labor markets in good shape and a gradual return of inflation to 2% - provide &quot;no reason to move as quickly or cut as rapidly as in the past.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This speech helped drive a distinct repricing higher in the market-implied Fed policy rate path this week. Consider at the end of Last week, markets had priced in an 80% probability for the first 25bp Fed rate cut in March and almost seven full 25bp cuts this year. The probability for a March rate cut has now fallen below 50% with a Little over five cuts priced in for this year.</span></p>
