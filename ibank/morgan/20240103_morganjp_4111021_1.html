<p><span class="font6">Although the top 100 developers’ December sales were weaker than expected (more in our </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">report</span><span class="font6">), in the past few days there were two marginally positive developments: (1) Major developers’ home delivery in 2023 ended up to be +14% Y/Y. and even distressed developers saw a 16% Y/Y growth, showing the impact of rescue funds on home delivery is playing out; and (2) there was an uptick in the PSL balance in December 2023 (Rmb350 billion). While the exact usage is not yet clear, the additional funding could partially go to either “ensuring home delivery” (fS 5S ^), which helps stabilize homebuyers’ confidence, or urban village renovation (tti’Ti&amp;ifi), which helps support real estate investment (or sales if cash compensation is involved). That said, without a meaningful pick-up in sales, we believe the Mainland China property sector may continue to underperform. Meanwhile, we also stay cautious on Hong Kong property with home prices continually dropping &amp;&nbsp;no meaningfill pick-up in office &amp;&nbsp;retail. We continue to recommend three pair trade ideas: (l)long Link REIT &amp;&nbsp;short Wharf REIC (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font6">) - </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more in </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">investor feedback</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">&quot;,</span><span class="font6"> (2) long CKA &amp;&nbsp;short NWD (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font6">): (3) long CR Land &amp;&nbsp;short Vanke-H (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link)</span><span class="font6">.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some progress in “ensuring home delivery’”: According to estimates from EH Consulting (note: the data is not official and the basis may be different from companies’ reporting), major developers’ home delivery (by number of units) rose 14% Y/Y on average (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Table 1</span><span class="font6">). By type, SOEs were +14% Y/Y and nondistressed POEs +4% Y/Y. Interestingly, distressed developers saw an outperforming 16% Y Y growth (although this is likely due to a low base). The positive Y/Y growth shows the progress in “ensuring home delivery”, which has been supported by (1) deployment of rescue funds through PSL funding (Rmb632 billion newly created from September 2022 to Februaiy 2023, although not all went to home delivery); (2) continual asset disposals by distressed developers; and (3) authorities imposing much stricter escrow account requirements.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implied 6% Y/Y growth in completions in December 2023: The 14% Y/Y growth in home delivery among major developers is not too far off from the 19% Y/Y growth in national residential completions in 11M2023 as reported by NBS (note: December data has not yet been released). If we assume national completions to see a similar 14% Y/Y growth for the hill year of 2023, the implied Y/Y growth in December would be +6%, which would be a deceleration from + 14% Y/Y in both October and November.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSL is revived: The pledged supplemental lending (PSL) balance saw a net increase of Rmb350 billion in December 2023, which is the first time since February 2023 (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">Figure 1</span><span class="font6">). While the exact usage is not exactly clear (it could be for home deliveiy, urban village renovation or other usage not related to the property sector), but if we assume it all goes into urban village renovation to support constraction activities, this represents -3% of FY23E real estate investment, or we </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">unrealistically</span><span class="font6"> assume it all goes into cash compensation to create new home demand within the same year, this represents -3% of FY23E national sales value.</span></p></li></ul>
