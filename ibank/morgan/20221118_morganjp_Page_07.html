<p><span class="font5">Last week we published the latest </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">High-Yield Bond and Institutional Loan Maturity Schedule</span><span class="font5">. 2022’s doubling in HY and LL yields has fueled a collapse in refi activity to a mere $105bn bond/loans in 2022, a low since ’08 and vs a lOyr average $365bn. Given the collapse in refi and rising growth risks, investors are refocusing their attention on the maturity schedule for high-yield and loan issuers. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Importantly, a manageable $262bn of high-yield bonds and leveraged loans mature in 2023 and 2024, which rises to $427bn in 2025, $502bn in 2026, and $488bn in 2027. </span><span class="font5">As such, a more than decade-high 21.5% of the leveraged credit base now comes due in the next three years. Notably, the combined total of $929bn coming due in 2025-26 accounts for 29% of the high-yield bond and loan markets. While the average time between call date and maturity is historically 3.47 years, about a third of the 6,500 calls we analyzed occurred inside 2yrs. Thus, issuers will continue to address some of 2024 and 2025 HY debt maturities in 2023. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the composition of the $262bn bonds and loans set to mature by the end of 2024? </span><span class="font5">This cohort is comprised of 453 issuers, which account for 19% of the 2,439 companies in the outstanding universe of bonds and loans. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Alternatively, 1,986 high-yield bond and loan companies (81%) have no maturities prior to 2025. </span><span class="font5">For issuers with debt maturing in 2023/24, 135 of the 453 issuers are bond-only issuers (30%) totaling $96.6bn in bonds (37%), while 229 are loan-only borrowers (51%) totaling $97.7bn in loans (37%) and 89 are crossover names (20%) totaling $67.8bn in bonds and loans (26%). Notably, bonds and loans maturing prior to 2025 are pricing in more credit risk trading 238bp and 546bp wide of the indices. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In the details, near-term maturities (2023-24) are comprised of $84bn of BB bonds and loans, $99bn of Single B and $79bn of CCC. </span><span class="font5">As such, 14% of lower-tier companies’ debt matures by the end of 2024 as compared to only 6% of B-rated companies’ debt loads and 8% of BB. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">What is the composition of the $929bn bonds and loans set to mature in 2025-26? </span><span class="font5">This cohort is comprised of 1,053 issuers or 43% of companies in the universe and the debt burden accounts for 52% of their $1.8tm debt load. Meanwhile, there are 1,354 high-yield bond and loan companies (55%) that have no maturities over the next 4 years. As an aggregate, neither the bonds nor loans maturing in 2025 and 2026 are pricing in any more credit risk than the overall market. The sectors with the largest debt load coming due in 2025/26 are Technology, Healthcare, Financial, and Sendees. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">And the sector with the lowest percentage of bonds and loans maturing by YE26 is Housing, </span><span class="font5">with Cable and Retail also low. Note 50% of lower-tier bonds are set to mature by YE26 versus 36% of the single-B universe and 32% of all BBs. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">On a count basis, 141 of bond and loan tranches maturing in 2023 rises to 333 in 2024,672 in 2025, and 720 in 2026. </span><span class="font5">For context, capital markets have producing about 1,500 bond and loan tranches per year over the past decade. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Note 57% of the 1,866 bond and loan tranches coming due over the next four years are less than $500mn. </span><span class="font5">Thus, issuers will “chop wood” in capital markets over the next few years as opportunities arise.</span></p>
