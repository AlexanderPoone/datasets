<p><span class="font2">Sinopharm has expanded into some new businesses recently, and although the scale of these businesses is relatively small now they offer potential top/bottom-line growth in the long term, in our view.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">1.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E-commerce- </span><span class="font2">Sinopharm is transferring its traditional businesses into e commerce/online platform, e.g it established its B2C platform, &quot;Sinopharm Online Co.” with the transaction amounted over Rmb 2,200million up to 1H16. Also, it set up &quot;Sinopharm Direct Sales&quot;, &quot;Sinopharm Group Overseas Flagship Stores&quot;. We believe with Sinopharm's large distribution network and logistics capability, its E-ecommerce business can rapidly ramp up further utilizing its integrated business platform. Furthermore, it launched its B2B platform to try to use ecommerce to optimize the resource and efficiency, interlink distribution, logistics, hospitals and suppliers and social welfare fund into the B2B platform.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">2.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Financial </span><span class="font2">leasing-Sinopharm began its financial leasing for its smaller distributors with invested capital of Rmb2 billion in early 2015. Now the business has rapidly grown to Rmblbn as of May 2016. This business enjoys higher gross margin of 80% and net profit margin of 10%, vs. Sinopharm's traditional business GM’s 8% and net profit margin of 2%. Leverage ratio of 5 times. Notably, the Company will continue to increase the scale of its financial leasing business. In 1H16, the Company has invested cRmblbn.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font2">3.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Electronic supply chain business: </span><span class="font2">Sinopharm also launched online supply chain with the business scale of over Rmb 1.5 billion.</span></p></li></ul>
