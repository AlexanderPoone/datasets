<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Flexibles’ priority segments contract in 4Q</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Flexibles’ sales were flat yoy in actual FX to US$11. Ibn and +c. 1 % in const FX (as c.4% pricing growth was offset by a c.3% drop in volumes yoy). However softening trends continued to accelerate into 4Q23 with weakness seen within priority sectors - I.e. Healthcare and Pet care, where growth has been more robust. Softening consumer demand, customer stocking as well as retailers holding lower levels of inventory going forward were all cited as some reasons for the weakness. Higher raw material costs saw FY23 EBIT margins drop to 12.8% in FY23 (FY22: 13.6%).</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Rigids volumes didn’t remain so</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rigids sales were +4% to US$3.5bn in FY23 with volumes -c.4% yoy in FY23. North American overall beverage volumes were -c.6% yoy in FY23 (but -8% in 4Q23) with hot fill flat/-6%, respectively for FY23/4Q23, a soft result in the traditionally strongest 4Q with cold/ preform volumes also weaker. Volumes were also softer in Latin America (low-single-digit rates. Despite cost management and recovery of raw material costs, margins were crimped by 100bps to 7.5% (pep: 8.5%).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">While input cost pressures remain, we highlight prices for key input resin have also seen moderation in recent months with US LDPE/ HDPE -c.30-45% since 30-Jun-22 and PP Homopolymer by c.50%. This, along with c.US$200m of cost-savings and a further US$50m p.a. in structural cost savings (of which US$35m is set to be realised in FY24 and predominantly in 2H24) from the Russian sale should also provide some relief in FY24 and beyond.</span></p>

<p><a name="bookmark8"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark9"></a>Balance sheet and cash flow</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Net debt increased to US$6.Ibn (FY22: US$5.7bn) with c.US$130m in acquisitions completed during FY23 (with minimal earnings contribution). Gearing metrics also increased to 3.Ox at 30-Jun-23 (vs. Dec-22 of 3.5x; Jun-22 of 2.7x). Given both a higher average debt balance and base rates, net interest expense increased significantly to US$260m. Management suggested c.70% of debt is fixed with the balance floating (vs. traditionally an equal split). Given softer operational earnings, higher interest and adverse working capital (on lower accounts payable/inventory reduction), adj. FCF was -20% yoy.</span></p>
