<p><span class="font5">The HK equity derivatives market has witnessed significant compression in the single stock vs index implied volatility since 2022, primarily attributable to a decrease in the volatility of individual stocks alongside an increased correlation among them Currently, the entry point for engaging in dispersion trading is near a two-year low (Figure 1). In this context, we screen for stocks where the potential for dispersion might be u nderappreciated in the market. Several catalysts could trigger increased dispersion in the near term. The upcoming earnings season in Febmary and March is a critical period to watch. Additionally, increased call buying activities from foreign investors and the possibility of earnings pre-announcements could potentially create more divergence in stock performances.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Dispersion pattern in HK stocks</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">During earnings season, stock prices often experience increased dispersion due to the influx of new information. This variance in earnings outcomes relative to market expectations leads to divergent stock performances, thereby increasing the dispersion in stock prices. To identify earnings sensitive stocks, we calculate the stock versus index realized volatility' over a one-month window encompassing two weeks before and after earnings are released. We then evaluate the median excess realized volatility against the current stock versus index implied volatility. This comparison helps determine the market’s pricing of expected dispersion compared to historical data. The hit ratio, defined as the likelihood of past earnings’ excess realized volatility surpassing the current implied volatility spread, is calculated. This ratio ranks stocks based on the probability of profitable dispersion trading during earnings at the present entry level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">To illustrate the dispersion pattern beyond the earnings period, we present an analysis of the stock versus index realized volatility spanning 12 calendar months. Although most stocks exhibit increased excess volatility during earnings seasons, selecting stocks with a historical tendency to offer greater dispersion beyond earnings remains a key interest for investors. This consideration is particularly relevant given that typical</span></p>
