<p><span class="font2">informatics (or synthetic long-reads), which had been tried unsuccessfully several times at ILMN (Moleculo, Avantome) due to sample prep, cost and workflow challenges. ONT management pointed out the scientific fact that short-read sequencing can only map 92% of the human genome, with the remaining 8% remaining dark regions (e.g., short tandem repeats) that require long-read sequencing assemble. Since Infinity is only synthetic long-reads (and only 10 kb reads vs. 50 kb+ for others), it is expected to have limitations around performance in tandem repeats and direct methylation detection, and as such, be aimed at applications skewed toward bacteria/small genome. PACB believes it will remain the best long-read platform with the highest accuracy, while ONT highlighted its unique true single-molecule technology, ultra-long reads (up to 4 Mb), as well as scalability and cost advantages (see </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">note</span><span class="font2"> from our European colleague James Gordon for more color).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to the short-read side with Chemistry X... </span><span class="font2">ILMN also gave an update on its new short-read sequencing chemistry in development (Chemistry X), which includes complete redesigns of dyes, blocks, linkers and enzymes, thus giving ILMN new IP (replacing the remaining SBS patents that expire in 2023). The new chemistry is expected to enable 2x faster cycle times, 2x longer reads and 3x greater accuracy, paving the path to a $100/genome. Chemistry X will replace the current SBS chemistry as the foundation for all future platforms. The company is currently developing new large-scale manufacturing facilities for the chemistry, suggesting near-term commercialization potential, although launch timing is undisclosed. In terms of competitors, PACB believes Chemistry X will be dramatically less accurate than PACB/Omniome’s SBB chemistry, which does not rely on informatics to enhance accuracy, and the potential need for new hardware to use Chemistry X could open up opportunities for PACB to make a competitor entry. In terms of OMIC, management believes that the rollout of Chemistry X will likely start from the high-end market, so it does not affect OMlC’s near-term commercialization in the benchtop market, and OMIC will continue its own innovation.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Growing competition regardless: </span><span class="font2">Overall, while ILMN clearly saw a strong stock reaction on the R&amp;D announcements, we do not see a fundamental change in the competitive landscape. As we noted in our 2022 </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">outlook</span><span class="font2">, multiple new entrants are challenging ILMN’s pseudo-monopoly, including OMIC (launched last month), PACB/Omniome (launching in 1H23), Element (benchtop, unveiling at AGBT), Ultima (high end vs. NovaSeq, unveiling at AGBT), and BGI (could enter the US as soon as this August due to invalidation of ILMN’s ‘444 patent). Finally, ONT is also starting to see growing traction in the shortread space, with the company highlighting two LBx studies concluding that nanopore sequencing could be a reliable, accurate alternative to ILMN’s shortread technology.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shifting to liquid biopsy, it was another area of investor focus, with GH getting the most attention. </span><span class="font2">GH announced the upcoming launch of Smart LBx this year, which will have a lOOx larger genomics footprint (panel size) than G360, including genomics, epigenomics and immune signatures, with internal data showing that Smart LBx can improve sensitivity by an order of magnitude, while not being cost-prohibitive due to innovative chemistry. Management envisions that Smart LBx will eventually replace G360 LDT and OMNI, and while the current focus is on biopharma partnerships through LDT to develop specific applications, the company will consider an IVD pathway in the future if it makes sense. Turning to cancer screening, GH will be a first mover to launch an LBx for CRC screening this year. In anticipation of the ECLIPSE trial</span></p></li></ul>
