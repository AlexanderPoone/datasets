<p><span class="font2">basis of merger accounting) and FYI 6 results will reflect a full year of post-merger financials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We see several potential sources of positive synergies which could result in improving volume stability/profitability, and strengthened port network coverage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Positive synergy 1: Potential cost savings and increased operating efficiency from greater control at certain ports</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most direct of potential positive synergies comes from the consolidation of the stakes at certain port assets where both CP (pre-m erger) and CSPD had an interest. This includes ACT in Hong Kong, which would become a subsidiary, Tianjin Five Continents, and Kao Ming in Taiwan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Positive synergy 2: Increased volumes due to merging of container shipping operations of COSCO and China Shipping</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another source of potential positive synergies comes from merged container shipping operations of COSCO and China Shipping and the subsequent formation of the new OCEAN alliance which will have the second largest combined global market share behind the 2M alliance (we note that Hyndai Merchant Marine recently signed an MOU to join 2M). Given CP's close relationship with its sister companies and the parent Group, we believe that CP's ports may be able to benefit from stronger and more stable volume flows with key assets serving as hub ports for the alliance while the non-overlapping route coverage of the two shipping companies pre-merger may result in new volumes coming to ports that were not part of the original route rotations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Positive synergy 3: Broadened global port network coverage could drive higher utilization and coordination</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the assets of the two groups consolidated under a single platform with limited overlapping stakes, the enlarge scale and widened network of operations could result in higher utilization of certain port assets (both domestically and internationally), particularly those that have the capacity to serve as regional hubs as they could become preferred ports of call for the alliance's vessels. Additionally, in areas where both operators have non-overlapping presences, the consolidation of assets could improve the competitive landscape through increased coordination (though this may take time to materialize).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Positive synergy 4: Transfer of management expertise could improve operational efficiency</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We believe the transfer and exchange of management expertise, likely more from the CP side, could help raise the management and operating efficiency of port assets particularly in regions where both operators had a presence in pre-consolidation. This would have the effect of raising the company’s return profile through improving throughput yields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">However, we believe these synergies are not easily quantifiable and thus have not explicitly factored such positive effects into our model.</span></p>
