<p><span class="font0">24 November2023</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">durable goods report were slightly negative with respect to 3Q GDP, and as a result we are lowered our tracking estimate of 3Q real GDP growth from 4.9% to still-strong 4.8% saar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thankful for claims</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Initial claims surprised favorably, with a drop from 233,000 to 209,000 reported for the week ending November 18 (Figure 4). This upbeat print came after a disappointing reading from last week, and filings can normally be noisy and especially volatile around holidays like Veterans Day. It is hard to see a clear trend in the recent figures, but filings generally have been low lately through the choppy readings, suggesting strength in the labor market. This picture is consistent with no clear trend either way on layoffs from the JOLTS data or relatively stable readings from the household survey on the level of short-term unemployment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Continuing claims also generally have been low lately. In the latest report, continuing claims filings moved down from 1.862mn to 1.840mn during the week ending November 11. This marked the first weekly decline for the seasonally adjusted series since early September, although </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">we think</span><span class="font3"> that the recent earlier climb may have reflected issues with the seasonal adjustment process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Inflation expectations stayed up</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In an otherwise light week for data releases, the University of Michigan survey provided some potentially worrying signs</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">about inflation expectations. Given the recent movesup, the survey's inflation expectation measures are worthy of more attention than the headline figure, which was revised up slightly between the preliminary and final November reports, still showing weakening relative to October. While it is important to take note of the recent move up in consumer inflation expectations from the University of Michigan survey, we should also keep in mind that this increase in inflation expectations has not been evident to the same degree in some other related measures (such as the New York Fed’s Survey of Consumer Expectations, although this report is more lagging).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the latest University of Michigan report, the median one-year-ahead inflation expectation was revised up, and it now shows an increase from 4.2% in October to 4.5% in November (vs. 4.4% in the preliminary report). Over just the past two months, this short-term inflation expectation measure has jumped 1.3%-pts (Figure 5). Elsewhere in the survey, the median five-year-ahead inflation expectation was unrevised in the final November release, and still shows an increase from 3.0% in October to 3.2% in November. This latest print on the longer-term measure matched the highest monthly reading reported since late 2008.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">More news to come</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A variety of economic indicators are scheduled for release next week, although the November employment report during the following week (released December 8) probably will trump next week’s reports in terms of influencing upcoming Fed policy decisions. Next week we’ll get an October print on core PCE inflation (forecast 0.21% m in) as well as a variety of GDP source data for the first month of 4Q. Timelier news on economic activity will come from automaker reports on November light vehicle sales. In more lagging news, we still expect a strong GDP print for 3Q despite an anticipated small downward revision and we correspondingly expect a big jump in corporate profits during that quarter.</span></p>
