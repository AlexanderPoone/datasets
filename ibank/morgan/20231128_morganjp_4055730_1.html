<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Commodity Market Positioning &amp;&nbsp;Flows</span></h4>
<p><span class="font3">Global commodity open interest largely stable as precious metals gains offset by agriculture losses</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated value of open interest across global commodity markets edged up over the week to $ 1.26 trillion, increasing by—$2 billion (0.2%) WOW as gains across petroleum products, metals and environment markets were only partially offset by a decline in crud eoiLnatu ral gas and agriculture markets (as of 24 Nov, Table 1). Following three consecutive weeks of outflows, global commodity markets absorbed inflows (calculated across all trader types) of $2.2 billion WOW, bringing YTD cumulative inflows to -$223 billion (as of 24 Nov, Figure 1). Weekly inflows were concentrated in precious metals ($2.7 billion), EUAs ($1.5 billion) and petroleum products ($1.7 billion), while agriculture and base metals registered modest outflows last week.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated value of the net long investor position aggregated across commodity markets increased by 9% over the week (21 Nov, Figure 3, Figure 4), with lengthening in net positions across metals and environment markets more than offsetting shortening in energy and agriculture. The notional value of the net investor position in the precious metals sector increased by 16% WOW, while agri sector notional investor length declined -8% WOW. Investors turned net long base metals after eight weeks of being net short.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated value of open interest across energy' markets increased by $1.2 billion (+0.2% WOW), driven primarily by petroleum products (+3% WOW) (24 Nov, Figure 12). Petroleum products also saw a net inflow of $1.7 billion, while crude oil and natural gas registered marginal net ou tflows (across all trader types). The broadly stable activity in crude is likely explained by the market awaiting a decision on output curbs from OPEC+ later this week with </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">our global oil strategists expecting existing cuts to be extended through 1024</span><span class="font5">.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The estimated value of open interest in precious metals markets increased by 3% WOW to -$159 billion, the highest level since late July (24 Nov, Figure 8). Gold and silver led contract-based inflows (across all trader ty pes) totalling $2.7 billion last week (as of 24 Nov) while Managed Money net length in COM EX Gold increased by 15k contracts WOW to 79.1k contracts (as of 21 Nov), the longest since early Au gust. However, despite gold prices pushing above $2,000/oz once again, overall investor positioning still remains near the historical middleof the range, screening around 5/10 on a standardized scale with 10 being the net longest positioning since 2018. To some degree, this hesitancy is likely a result of gold prices trading quite rich vs u nderlying rates and FX fundamentals that currently point towards a ‘fair’ value closer to $l,900/oz. While this con Id leave gold vulnerable to a pu 11 back i n the near-term, ou r strategists </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">remain structurally bullish on a longer-term horizon</span><span class="font5">, seeing a 2H24 Fed cutting cycle catalyzi ng a n eve nt u al brea kou t rally i n gold, pu shi ng p rices</span></p>
