<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>This time is different</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A key building block of our macroeconomic forecasts in the aftermath of the pandemic shock is that dramatic changes have taken place in key areas that depressed neutral policy rates last decade. In particular,</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Private sector balance sheets have improved materially. </span><span class="font6">One of the unusual features of the pandemic recession is that it generated an improvement in private sector balance sheets. Lockdowns during 2020-21 generated forced savings while government fiscal supports boosted household income and provided businesses with access to credit. The upshot of these developments is that the DM private sector has moved through the early phase of this expansion with excess savings and reduced leverage, developments which have promoted resiliency in the face of significant shocks (Figure 5).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No credit overhang to unwind. </span><span class="font6">In the aftermath of the GFC the global economy went a prolonged period in which private sector credit demand remained weak despite low interest rates (Figure 6). In the immediate aftermath of the 2008-9 recession this impulse was greatest in DM as households de-levered following a housing boom, the financial sector pulled back, and business sector hiring and spending remained cautious. Starting in 2013 a decade long boom in EM private sector credit unwound and was an important drag on global demand through the end of the expansion.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The absence of a large fiscal shock, so far. </span><span class="font6">Although budget deficits fallen from a 2020 spike which pushed DM deficits to a level of 11% of GDP, fiscal policy is not moving in the aggressive counter-cyclical fashion seen over 2011-15. To be sure there are notable drags as US transfers programs and European short-term work programs have been removed and spending on CO VID vaccines and treatments have been reduced. However, the sharp sustained slide in government spending in Europe and the US in the early years of the post-GFC expansion is not materializing during this expansion.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font6">Alongside the removal of forces weighing on private sector demand, the pandemic has also altered the Philips-curve dynamics. Following a long period in which inflation remain stable in the face of significant variations in DM unemployment rates, inflation surged sharply during 2021-22 (Figure 8). Markets have looked through this spike as supply shocks have heavily influenced post-pandemic inflation. However, this year’s disinflation dynamic will likely prove substantial but incomplete. Absent a recession dynamic taking hold, we anticipate views to shift about the interest rate that will be necessary to return inflation back to within central bank comfort zones.</span></p>
