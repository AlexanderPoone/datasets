<p><span class="font5">The holiday-shortened week was light on data releases, but what little data we received suggested the economy is cooling down but not collapsing. Existing home sales in October slid even further, reaching the slowest pace of resales since 2010. The October report on manufacturers of durable goods was also on the light side. Orders and shipments of nondefense capital goods (ex-aircraft)—a proxy for business capital spending—have been basically flat over the past two months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">On the brighter side, new filings for unemployment benefits fell in the latest weekly report, indicating a still-solid labor market. Overall, while we don’t have a lot of data on 4Q it looks like real GDP growth is stepping down from its sizzling 4.9% annualized pace last quarter, and we are comfortable with our projection for 2.0% growth this quarter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Against this backdrop, the minutes to the November 1 FOMC meeting were released this week. It now appears the debate at the Fed has shifted from how much more tightening to how long to keep rates elevated. While further hikes are still on the table, that would only occur “if incoming information indicated that progress toward the Committee’s inflation objective was insufficient”—which sounds more like a risk than a baseline scenario. The more decisive statement about future policy was: “All participants judged that it would be appropriate for policy to remain at a restrictive stance for some time until inflation is clearly moving down sustainably toward the Committee’s objective.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">More downbeat news from housing</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">We have seen continued signs of weakness in the housing sector this week. Existing home sales dropped in October to the lowest level since 2010 (Figure 1), down by 14.6%oya. Even though pending home sales (which generally lead existing home sales) showed a modest improvement in the last report, the housing market still faces strong headwinds. A combination of higher mortgage rates, despite a recent move down, and limited inventory on the market has been restraining home sales for a while now. The trend is clearly down in existing home sales, especially since policy tightening started in early 2022. This aggregate trend does not seem to be a product of one region or type of market, and being more</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">broad-based, looks consistent with the adverse effects from the macro environment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Moreover, limited availability seems to be preventing house price declines, which might be also reinforcing the downward trend in existing home sales. The median existing-home sales price climbed 3.4% from one year ago in the latest report (Figure 2). As we have argued in our 2024 Outlook, we think these challenges in the housing market will persist into next year and likely will continue to drag overall growth, albeit not as significantly as over the recent past.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Softer capital spending</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Further signs of cooling in business spending were evident in the durable goods report for October this week. New orders for durable goods declined more than was anticipated in the month, mostly reflecting a plunge in aircraft orders, which can be veiy noisy from month to month. Many of the key details within the report were soft, but not nearly as downbeat as the headline print. Away from transportation, new orders were unchanged in October, and orders for core capital goods (which exclude defense and aircraft) edged down 0.1% (Figure 3). Core capital goods shipments, meanwhile, were basically unchanged in October. Hard data on 4Q are very limited at this point, but with the figures in hand we think real equipment spending remains on track for modest growth in the current quarter (likely in the low-single digits).
