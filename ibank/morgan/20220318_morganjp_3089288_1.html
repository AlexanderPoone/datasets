<p><span class="font6">In this report, we summarize the presentations and Q&amp;A with management teams who attended this week’s J.P. Morgan Industrials conference. During the event we hosted 11 companies, in addition to moderating panel discussions on autonomous tiucking and supply chain disiuptions. We also hosted a small group dinner with several private companies to discuss freight tech trends and moderated the Day 3 keynote with the Founder and CEO of Flexport. As expected, none of the five rails attending changed their guidance although Norfolk delayed its investor day to the back-half of the year and CN noted its 2022 guidance was “aggressive” several times during the Q&amp;A. See below for a summary of key themes and takeaways from the conference with full recaps starting on page three.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rail labor additions are breaking throughout after months of no increases. </span><span class="font6">Labor has long been a constraint on volume growth due to both the macro conditions and the length of time it takes to get a new hire qualified and on the network. However, a number of rails expressed encouraging signs that labor is beginning to turn the corner. NS expects improvement in 2Q22 given the fourmonth lead time to place a new hire in the field and CSX has re-engineered its hiring processes and is looking at the idea of restructuring jobs to boost retention. February STB data supports the outlook as the T&amp;E workforce covered good ground industry-wide moving up +2.8% MoM. Eastern rail T&amp;E labor was up +3% MoM at CSX and +2.3% at NS. UP remains the best situated of the group with a modest T&amp;E increase on best-in-class volumes up +4.3% QTD. The increased labor should help support the anticipated 2H22 recovery.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commodity price shock boosts select end markets while fuel costs drag OR. </span><span class="font6">Energy related business tied to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and rising fuel prices were consistent themes but revealed different outcomes by network. Eastern rails look to benefit from increased export coal prices as producers are interested in moving more volume. However, CSX noted the primary challenge is network capacity constraints which will delay bringing incremental tons to market. UP’s sizeable exposure to soybeans and corn should be in play but weather must hold up to support the export grain opportunity. CP has the broadest exposure with openings in frac sand, CBR and potash. Higher fuel prices are expected to impact earnings in 1Q22 with a ftiel surcharge lag and OR pressure with a higher percentage of fuel surcharge revenue.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A comprehensive update from supply chain experts. We </span><span class="font6">took a deep-dive into the state of the global supply chain with opinions from Flexport’s Founder and CEO Ryan Petersen, Gene Seroka - Executive Director of the Port of L.A., Dr. Phil Levy - Chief Economist at Flexport and Adam Compain - an SVP of Product Marketing at project44. The experts all agreed that congestion was likely to last into 2023 unless there was a significant demand shock. There is no one easy fix for this challenge considering the interconnected nature of global supply chains buffeted by near constant volatility in the last two years. Visibility can be hard to obtain for supply chains but the speakers recommended data-driven insights like Flexport’s ocean timeliness indicator, container dwell times and chassis availability, and metrics from the project44 market intel product.</span></p></li></ul>
