<p><span class="font4">Tapping Into Water Utilities: Initiating on AWK and WTRG With Neutral Ratings</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We initiate coverage on American Water Works Company, Inc. (AW K) and Essential Utilities, Inc. (W'TRG) with Neutral ratings. </span><span class="font7">The water and wastewater utility industry remains a unique subsector within the broader utilities industry given the fragmented nature of water utilities across the country and the limited number of investor owned corporates in the space. Our Neutral rating for both AWK and WTRG is mostly predicated on relative value, as we don’t expect either name to trade materially tighter to some of the higher quality regulated utilities in the space, such as XEL. AWK has the stronger credit profile between the two names, driven by its geographic diversity and higher contribution from its water business compared to WTRG, but we think both companies remain well positioned as defensive, low risk credits even relative to the broader regulated utilities sector. On the other hand, both companies are likely to maintain thin financial cushions above their downgrade thresholds, driven by elevated capital expenditures and an acquisitive strategy to consolidate the largely fragmented space.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law remains a near-term catalyst. </span><span class="font7">The $55 billion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) that was passed in November 2021 remains a primary driver of growth investment for the sector over the next several years. Regardless, water infrastructure remains one of the more underinvested areas within the U.S., with lead and chemical contaminants, water loss, and access to clean water a problem in a number of municipalities. Underinvestment in the sector is partially driven by the lack of access to capital, as well as a lack of political prioritization since many of these mains were constructed fifty years ago. The majority of funds provided by the BIL will be directed toward the replacement of lead pipes, and provide liquidity to drinking water improvement and water pollution projects.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unique environmental characteristics. </span><span class="font7">From an ESG perspective, water utilities remain advantaged within the space from an environmental angle due to the subsector’s smaller greenhouse gas emission profile and liinited exposure to waste and pollution risks. Relative to gas and electric utilities, aging water infrastructure has comparatively limited tail risks as well, which may lend to the subsector’s historically lower priority for investment over the last several decades. Regardless, water utilities are exposed to similar governance and social concerns as their electric and gas counterparts, particularly with ongoing concerns over safe drinking water in MI and other states. For that reason, the scope of acquisition targets for water utilities could be limited to higher quality municipalities, preventing some more risk prone regions from reaping the benefits of a broader consolidation strategy. AWK and WTRG’s main drawback from an ESG perspective is their environmental trajectories, which we define in our model as the ability for a utility to improve upon its current environmental score, though we see this as a minor issue and is attributed to the water subsector’s low carbon intensity on a historical basis.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risks to our ratings. </span><span class="font7">Risks to our ratings for both AWK and WTRG include environmental risks associated with water sourcing, highly acquisitive growth strategies, and aggressive capital spending programs.</span></p></li></ul>
