<p><span class="font3">China Lesso (2128 HK)</span></p>
<h6><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Largest plastic pipe maker seeing some recovery</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">China Lesso is one of the largest makers of plastic pipes and pipe fittings in China. We recently visited the production base of Lesso in Dongguan, Southern China. Key takeaways include the continual strength of government-related underground pipe demand, some small recovery in pipes used in residential construction, particularly in Southern China, as well as a number of new businesses that Lesso is adding in order to drive future growth. All of these new businesses leverage on the low cost production and strong R&amp;D of Lesso as well as Lesso’s established relationships with over 22,000 outlets throughout China selling construction materials. Sentiment is improving in the construction material segment in 2016 and Lesso has an advantage of supplying to a stable government-related infrastructure market as well as a recovering private residential housing market. Lesso is trading at about 5.4x our CY16 P/E and consensus CY16 PE of about 6x. The share price of Lesso is up 3% over the past three months compared with a 13% increase in the HSCEI.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dongguan plant. </span><span class="font4">The site is the location of Lesso’s large st pipe production facility as well as the center of its fish farm infrastructure and lessomall businesses (both new in 2015). The site is the center of several nearby facilities that supply Guangdong province, which is nearly 50% of total sales for Lesso. (Lesso has over a 40% market share in Guangdong for plastic pipes used in construction and about 14-15% of China’s pipe market.) Lesso has nearly 20 plants in 15 provinces and is four times larger than the next largest pipe maker in China.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lessomall growth drivers for the future. </span><span class="font4">Lessomall is the new service (started Feb 2015) that Lesso provides to partners in the building materials/component space. Lesso offers a seamless one-stop service for over 500 partners (factories and brands) where Lesso arranges the sale, delivery and collection of receivables of construction materials (mainly non-decorative lighting, electrical, fixtures) on behalf of its partners fora fee. Lesso is well positioned to offer these services because it already sells its pipes to over 22,OCX) outlets throughout China. Lessomall has a few growth drivers in 2016 that were not in place in 2015. First, sales in 2015 were confined to Guangdong, but would be rolled out in many provinces in 2016 by doubling the number of distributors from under 1,000 in 2015 to around 2,000 in 2016 (each distributor handles 8-12 outlets). Lesso would also work with rural retailers that currently don't sell Lesso pipe products as well expanding the reach of lessomall products. We note that the greater variety of products offered by lessomall could also entice more new retailers to sell Lesso core pipe products (not current Lesso distributors).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Government plans to modernize underground piping. </span><span class="font4">There are currently about 15 cities (major ones in China) that are trialing a new initiative to install various underground pipes in underground conduits and tunnels that can facilitate easy repairs and upgrades. This requires significant investment in digging up old pipes and laying new pipes in specialized conduits which benefits Lesso. Lesso is the number-one provider of pipes in China and should see demand rise if the trend for large cities to upgrade underground piping is pushed by the central government.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish aquaculture still in expansion mode. </span><span class="font4">Lesso began selling pipe-based fish infrastructure (up to 80 m diameter round floating structures supporting nets that can raise fish at up to 300m from the shoreline) to Southern China fish farms in 2H15. These can cost up to Rmb80k each and are subsidized (25% to 50%) by the government in order to increase fish farming capacity and improve efficiency and lower pollution. 2016 is the second year of supplying pipebased fish raising facilities and Lesso plans to increase sales significantly. While aquaculture sales are still a small part of earnings, Lesso is the largest and likely sole supplier in China right now and should benefit from the government push for modern aquaculture.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to replicate e-commerce under international GD home brand. </span><span class="font4">Lesso has a long-term plan to replicate its success in lessomall in overseas regions, first looking at markets around Bangkok, Thailand, and Dubai, UAE. This is a</span></p></li></ul>
