<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An otherwise quiet week brought moderate financial debt issuance. Highgrade issuance has broadly been underwhelming in April thus far in comparison to prior years, and spreads still finished wider on the week in the belly of the curve. Tax receipts appear to be similarly underwhelming, suggesting that the critical date for resolving the debt ceiling is likely biased earlier than our current estimate</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to see spreads as wide to fair value in the belly, and diminished bank demand for USTs is likely to weigh on spreads - initiate swap spread narrowers in the 7Y sector. We also continue to favor front end spread wideners and spread curve flatten-ers in the 2s/5s sector</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of banks reported earnings this week. As we had thought, AOCI improvements exceeded our statistical estimates for the quarter (coming in at $12bn for a partial list of the top 14 domestic banks in aggregate versus the estimate of $7bn), suggesting that banks were opportunistic in taking advantage of lower intra-quarter yield levels to shed duration. Deposit balances fell overall, but by relatively more (-1.8%) at mid-tier banks versus large banks (-0.6%)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In options markets, we recommend maintaining a long gamma bias as the policy path remains highly uncertain and the medium term range of possibilities being priced into implied distributions span continued hikes as well as large eases, creating conditions that can sustain elevated jump risk</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as broader barometersofthecrisis continue to point to stabilization, vol-rate correlations remain negative and the repricing of skews in March have been slow to retrace. We see value in selling lYxlOY low strike receiver swaptions versus buying high strikes, as an attractive way to position for continued normalization</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Debt and Taxes</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The two most notable developments of this otherwise quiet week were corporate debt issuance and the passing of tax-day. The magnitude of debt issuance as well as Treasury’s tax receipts have both been so mewhat underwhelming. With respect to the former, overall high grade issuance has totaled $26bn thisweekand $48.6bnso far in April. These are not unusually large - indeed, this month has seen the lowest issuance in comparison to April issuance ineach of the past five years. As a result, the narrowing pressure on swap spreads haslikely only been modest, and spreads are actually modestly wider over the week (Figure 1). With respect to the latter, our Treasury strategists have noted that tax receipts thus far are tracking o ver $ 1 OObn short of the2022 trend. Thus, risks to ourprojected date when the Treasury will run out of its extraordinary measures are likely biased somewhat earlier relative to our rough estimate of mid-August (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Treasury Market Daily</span><span class="font4">. Jay Barry, 4/20/23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Looking ahead, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">our views on swap spreads remain largely the same. </span><span class="font4">At the front end of the curve, swap spreads remain narrow to fair value as we have noted in recent weeks and we continue to recommend spread wideners in this sector (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Banking on Earnings</span><span class="font4">). We also see spreads in the belly as wide to fair value, and likely to narrow in the weeks ahead. As seen in Figure 2, swap spreads in intermediate maturities such as the 7-year sector are currently wide relative to fair value. Moreover, it is worth noting that bank demand for USTs stemming from deposit growth is one of the factors in our model for benchmark swap</span></p>
