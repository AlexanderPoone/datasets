<h6><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Factory visit highlights</span></h6>
<p><span class="font4">We recently visited the production base of XYG in Dongguan, Southern China. The key takeaways include the use of clean natural gas fuel for glass production, use of high quality but low cost domestic equipment and the cost savings arising from co-location of numerous different types of glass production in one location. Demand for auto glass continues to be healthy and we are seeing some improvements in float and construction glass as well. We note the numerous purchases of XYG shares over the past 2 weeks by the CEO of XYG (over 3m shares) as an indication of confidence of a recovery by senior management.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dongguan plant description. </span><span class="font4">The site is the location of XYG's first float glass line and also has a significant auto glass line (both OEM and aftermarket) as well as low E-construction glass production. The site now contains 4 of the 19 total float glass lines for XYG with a total production capacity of over 15,000 tons per day (or about 10-12% of China’s total capacity for modern float glass). XYG’s plants in China cover over 5m sm in land used for glass production in China with key sites in Dongguan, Jiangmen and Shenzhen in the south, Wuhu (Anhui) in the center, Tianjin and Yingkou in the north, Deyang in the west and the new plant in Malaysia currently under construction.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Localization of capital equipment. </span><span class="font4">XYG has been making float glass for over 8 years and has developed in-house EPC for new lines (float, construction and auto) procuring most equipment from local sources (except low E-coating machines used in construction glass. The cost of installing its own lines can be much cheaper than relying on third party contractors (sometimes a little as a third the cost) and this is one of the reasons for the low cost structure of XYG. We also saw some of XYG’s high end windshield production equipment, which was sourced from Northern Europe before 2010, and that is now designed by XYG and procured from suppliers in China.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clean efficient production. </span><span class="font4">XYG only uses natural gas for its glass production and its cost has come down by 40-50% since peaking in 2014. The quality of the glass made using natural gas is generally better than that made by oil or coal fuels as natural gas burns at a more even predictable temperature with less soot and other pollutants. The large cost disadvantage of using natural gas from 2013 to 2014 has all but disappeared with the latest correction in gas prices.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font4">XYG also benefits from a 10% cost advantage in its construction glass division as it is able to source cheap float glass at the adjacent float glass line that does not require any protective packaging (thus saving cost for the construction line). We believe XYG has one of the cleanest and lowest cost glass production for all the major products (float, construction, auto) and is poised to benefit as demand recovers in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Findings from recent visits to other construction related companies</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our recent visit to a construction site by China State Construction (3311 HK - OW, CSC) in Jiaxing in Eastern China revealed that there has been a significant increase in the cost of some construction materials since 4Q15 as construction activity heated up after the CNY holidays. In addition, wage growth for construction is also higher than 10% YY, and in some cases much higher. This indicates still a tight market for certain types of labor. It’s encouraging to see a faster pace of both private and public construction in the Yangtze delta region. CSC management said that construction is improving in the area around Jiaxing and is consistent with some favorable figures on new home construction released by the government (see below). If these improvements hold up (over very low numbers in 2015), then we should see the sentiment improve not only for CSC but for other construction material and related companies such as SMID - Caps under coverage (Xinyi Glass, China Lesso, Haitian, Kingboard Chern. Skyworth, etc).</span></p>
