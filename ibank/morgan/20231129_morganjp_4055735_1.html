<p><span class="font6">Fundamentals will likely remain stable despite different drivers across the region. Ultimately, we think strong balance sheets and risk discipline will insulate from ratings pressure. On the other hand, EM Asia financials approach the Year of the Dragon with valuations that are fair to rich, in our view, with ATI on the rich side after having outperformed YTD: this may limit returns. We recommend Tier 2 bonds and have only a few select picks in ATI and non-bank financials.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fu nd a mentals will likely remain stable despite different drivers across the region. Ultimately, we think strong balance sheets and risk discipline mean that headwinds are unlikely to result in ratings pressure. Earnings may enjoy tailwinds from loan growth in rapidly growing jurisdictions like India, where loans have been growing close to 20% y/y, but expansion of net interest margins is less likely to be as much of a driver as in 2023. Hong Kong banks may suffer from negative loan growth and see pressure on credit costs due to a sluggish recovery in the property market; banks with lower levels of loan loss allowance may see a faster increase in credit costs.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuations are fair to slightly rich. The sector’s valuations against most comparables that we follow are within the historical range. We think the sector is somewhat rich relative to IG corporates. Compared to DM financials, Asia hasn’t moved.The relationship started the year at 56bp and is now (November 22) at 53bp. On the other hand, additional Tier 1 (ATI) screens on the rich side compared to European ATI. This supports our selective view on the space.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We forecast US$51.8bn of issuance from financials, up 20% from 2023’s year-to-date figure. We expect China to be the largest contributor, at 39% of the total. Away from the largest issuing countries, we expect a jump in issuance from India financials, to US$5.5 billion. TLAC is no longer an overhang for China’s G-SIBs, with these banks well on their way to meeting the requirement with issuance of Tier 2 bonds in the domestic market.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recommend Tier 2 bonds a nd only select ATI and non-bankfinancials. Asia financials have returned 4.8% YTD, with ATI outperforming, returning 5.8%. The sector’s short duration of only 2.6 years provided some insulation against rate moves; spread tightening was modest at only lObp. We think the sector can tighten somewhat in 2024due to stable fundamentals and supportive technicals. Tier 2 bonds across the region look attractive compared to senior bonds. Valuations for ATI are in many cases closer to fair, leaving this part of the capital stiucture vulnerable to decompression; we are mindful of the tail risks of this instalment.</span></p></li></ul>
