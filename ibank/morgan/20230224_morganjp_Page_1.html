<p><span class="font9">Last night, post EU market close, we attended the ACIP Working Group meeting for nirsevimab ahead of the ACIP recommendation meeting (potentially in June 2023), with the focus of this meeting on cost effectiveness of nirsevimab. Broadly, we were encouraged by the ACIP Working Group’s conclusion that they would favour nirsevimab use, with a high level of certainty on efficacy against both RS V LRTI and RSV LRTI hospitalisations, seemingly increasing the likelihood of a positive recommendation. While some logistical questions were discussed on the current designation of nirsevimab as a drug rather than a vaccine, these seem broadly manageable and the Committee acknowledged the need for immunisation in infants. The only notable challenge was on the $500 price point proposed by Sanofi with the Working Group more comfortable with a $300 price per dose. However, with a 1-month extension of nirsevimab’s administration period from October to March (rather than from October to February assumed in Sanofi’s analysis) leading to a significant reduction in the cost per QALY of $ 108k (from $245k) which is much closer to the CDC analysis of $103k per QALY for the $300 price tag, we still see a $500 price pointas potentially supportable, though see this as a likely ongoing discussion point. We model nirsevimab peak sales of €1.5bn globally (€1. Ibn US), worth c. 2% to our NPV. </span><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">Overall, we see the meeting last night as potentially supportive of a broad ACIP recommendation across both all infants (first year) and high risk infants (second year) either in June 2023 or October 2023 depending on FDA approval, which we see as a minor positive.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CDC Working Group see $300/dose as most cost effective, with Sanofi’s proposed $500 price receiving some challenge. </span><span class="font9">The cost effectiveness analysis conducted by the CDC indicated that a $300 price per dose would equate to a cost per QALY (quality adjusted life year) of $ 103k using the CDC model, which assumes nirsevimab administration from October to March. Sanofi’s $500 price with proposed administration period from October to February equated to $245k, though extending the intervention period to March reduced this to $108k in the CDC model. The Working Group raised some concern around the proposed $500 price, with half of the working group supportive of $500 and the other half more mixed.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font9" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACIP Working Group see risk benefit profile as favourable, concluding that they favour nirsevimab use. </span><span class="font9">The Working Group concluded that they had a high level of certainty on nirsevimab’s efficacy against RS V LRTI (lower respirator tract infections) and on preventing RSV LRTI hospitalisations, which we see as a positive given that the ACIP do not seem to be waiting on the results of the Phase III HARMONIE study to be able to conclude on efficacy against hospitalisations. The safety profile was also seen as favourable.</span></p>
