<p><span class="font4">TGA (which fell to a dangerously low level of below $50bn this week), which is likely to bring a spate of T-bill issuance. We discuss all of this in a recent note published yesterday (see </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">Open the floodgates</span><span class="font4">, 6/1/23).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But this week was not all about the debt ceiling, with several noteworthy developments impacting the monetary policy outlook. Economic data has been surprisingly robust this week - this was most notably the case with the JOLTS Job Openings data, but was echoed more broadly by better housing data, confidence data, jobless claimsand finally the strong Payrolls report on Friday (although the unemployment rate ticked up to 3.7%). In addition, Fedspeak has leaned hawkish recently - comments by Kashkari, Bullard (nv) and Waller all pointed to further tightening ahead. Perhaps more interestingly, Vice-Chair designee Jefferson hinted at possibly &quot;skipping&quot; June, and that a such a skip was not inconsistent with additional hikes thereafter. All inall, the combination of healthy data and hawkish Fedspeak has helped pressure forward OIS higher at upcoming meeting dates (Figure 1).</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">All these developments are potentially significant for the derivatives markets. The TGA-re-build is likely toprove significant for the composition of the Fed's liabilities, and thus relevant for the outlook for bank deposits, repo rates, swap spreads and even the very outlook for QT over the medium term At the same time, still-shifting rate-hike expectations are likely to be a critically important driver of the curve and volatility. We discuss all of these below.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>The likely impact of TGA rebuild</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The passage of the debt ceiling suspension bill by Congress sets the stage for a rapid rebuild of the TGA, which fell to dangerously low levels this week. We expect the TGA to grow to $250bn by the end of June, and to $600bn by the end of September. This will likely be accomplished via ~$850bn in T-bill net issuance between now and the end of 3Q23. This shaip rise in the TGA, over a 4 month period where (if QT continues as we expect) the Fed’s total assets will decline by an additional -$300 bn, means that the sum total of Reserves and RRPbalances will need to decline by -$850bn between now and the end of September. What is less obvious at first glance is the relative split between Reserves and RRP balances in absorbing this decline.</span></p>
