<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Encouraging policy signals</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The appointment of key posts led to a swift improvement in investor sentiment</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The CBRT has delivered the expected hike and policy simplification; the next move could be a cut</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect the current account deficit to narrow</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The treasury’s borrowing requirements will remain </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">high despite a stronger fiscal performance</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The appointments of prudent and market-friendly names to key posts, and Erdogan’s seemingly strong support for rule-based policies centered on free-market practices led to a sharp improvement in investor confidence and a reversal in market dynamics in Turkey. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This was further supported by the latest CBRT decision. Governor Agbal started his term in quite a prudent and determined way. In the first MFC meeting of his term, the CBRT delivered the needed and expected monetary tightening in a blunt way and again as expected simplified its policy framework. The Bank hiked its key policy rate (1-week repo rate) by 475bp to 15.00%. Importantly, the CBRT also simplified its policy framework and announced that all funding would be provided by the 1-week repo facility and hence the 1 -week repo rate will be the only indicator for the monetary stance. This constituted a significant move towards orthodox implementing more orthodox policies and an increase in transparency. Despite higher interest rates, GDP growth should still rebound from an expected</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">- 0.6% this year to 3.6% in 2021, thanks to the recovery in investor sentiment and the expected rebound in global demand.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Price pressures are likely to weaken</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With ex-post inflation around 12-13% and with expected inflation around 10%, Turkey will now be providing real interest rates that will be inferiorare only lower to those after the 2018 crisis. Bearing in mind that the economy was growing at full speed and investor confidence was much lower in 2018, we believe these rates, along with a cautious rhetoric and continued tightening bias, would suffice this time around. In fact, the COVID-19 related restrictions and higher interest rates will likely depress domestic demand and thus demand-led inflationary pressures should decline. Furthermore, given that the fiscal performance has been stronger than envisaged, there is hardly any need for administrative price hikes. This means FX pass-through could be the main risk to price stability. The appointment of credible names to key posts and bold move in last review meeting have reduced this risk substantially. In fact, the lira has already appreciated by 12% against the US dollar since the appointments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Hence, barring any unexpected jump in inflation and/or a sudden increase in geopolitical risks, we think that 15% could be the cyclical peak in policy rate. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The next move will most likely be a cut. We expect easing to be very gradual, starting with a 50bp cut in April. Strong credibility recovery and an earlier-than-expected de-dollarization by residents could bring forward the easing cycle, while possible policy missteps or geopolitical risks could push back this easing, and even introduce the need for further tightening.</span></p>
