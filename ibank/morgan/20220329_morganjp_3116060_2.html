<p><span class="font1">with or higher than scalable Software and Internet Services: Semis ~32%, Software 31%, and Interactive Media at 26%). While these margins are often a target of political rhetoric during elections, investors are generally paid to fade headlines. More so, a gridlock outcome from the upcoming midterm elections should be a positive for the sector. As for inflation, Healthcare margins are more insulated during periods of rising costs and inflation given agriculture and energy' are not significant inputs for Healthcare (unlike its defensive peer Staples, which is one of the largest users of commodities). Healthcare also has lower exposure to wage pressures given its asset-lite structure. Despite stronger organic growth and richer margins, Healthcare trades at a significant discount to Staples ( 16x vs. 20x for Staples).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Summary of investment theses for Healthcare sub-sectors with more details, including highest conviction ideas from J PM stock analysts, in the body of the report:</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all">
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US Major and Specialty Pharma. </span><span class="font1">Industiy fundamentals are healthier than expected with expectations for MSD top-line growth and HSD EPS growth. With a -40% discount in tenns of valuation vs. market, Major phanna continues to be attractive with room for multiple expansion. While there has been rotation out of higher growth multiple areas (e.g. Animal Health), the fundamental picture remains unchanged.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Biotech. </span><span class="font1">The industry remains under pressure from an uneven regulatoiy environment, clinical setbacks, struggling legacy business and weak investor sentiment driven by financing overhangs and deal volume. Fundamentals, however, remain relatively intact with an increasingly attractive valuation. Potential near-term catalysts could be M&amp;A and clinical/regulatoiy successes. We particularly favor companies with strong valuation backstops, potentially disruptive tech platforms and healthy balance sheets (e.g. cash runway &gt;24 months).</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medical Devices. </span><span class="font1">Medtech could be positioned for upside on increasing optimism around Covid antivirals, robust pipeline/innovation cycle and healthy balance sheet position for pursuing M&amp;A opportunitics'rcinvestment buybacks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managed Care. </span><span class="font1">The industiy should continue to benefit from secular trends in Medicare Advantage penetration driving membership growth for MCOs. Given the ongoing economic recovery, prescription drug utilization is expected to rebound to pre-pandemic levels with the potential for strong growth tailwinds.</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Healthcare Technology &amp;&nbsp;Distribution. </span><span class="font1">The two most important themes in the industiy are consumerization of healthcare and shift to value-based care. The rising cost of healthcare has been driving patients to demand convenience and price transparency, while also providing strong patient engagement. We expect the rising importance of data to benefit healthcare IT vendors.</span></p>
<div>
</div><br clear="all"></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life Sciences. </span><span class="font1">The industiy has been under pressure given the ongoing intra-sector rotation towards phanna/managed care/med tech and the broader sector rotation out of Healthcare/Growth. Tougher comps, fading Covid tailwinds and macro concerns remain key risks.</span></p>
