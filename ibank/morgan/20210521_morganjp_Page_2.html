<p><span class="font6">Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have once again dominated headlines as many tokens lost 20-30% (or more) of their value in only a few days. Though a large and increasingly impactful asset class in its own right, these moves have been mostly confined to that market, with little evidence of spillover let alone contagion (see also </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">The J.P. Morgan Viewx</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font6"> J. Normand et al., 5/21/21). Even price action in gold, for which Bitcoin in particular is often considered a competitor as a store of value, has been roughly uncorrelated on a daily basis over the past two weeks. That said, there are areas in which we see and expect more interconnectedness between the crypto and traditional markets. </span><span class="font5">Though it may be surprising, one area is money markets and funding spreads though the growth of stablecoins and the investment of their reserve assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">First, a brief primer. </span><span class="font6">Stablecoins are digital tokens that, as the name implies, are designed to maintain a stable exchange rate into U.S. dollars and other currencies (for an overview, see </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Can stablecoins achieve global scale?,</span><span class="font6"> J. Younger et al., 12/3/19). The most common form is asset-backed, where the tokens in principle represent a claim on a pool of fiat currency securities (the reserve account) which are typically focused on short-term, highly liquid instruments. Another is algorithmic, for which creation (minting) and destruction (burning) is automated to maintain their peg. The former is by far more common, making up -95% of total market capitalization at present.</span></p>

<p><span class="font6">Though always an interesting diversion, the exposure growth of this segment of the market has made their activity potentially much more impactful. More than $60bn such tokens have been minted since the beginning of the year, a roughly three fold increase </span><span class="font5">(Exhibit 1). That makes them collectively among the largest prime fund-style liquidity portfolios globally. </span><span class="font6">This likely relates primarily to increased turnover in the ciyptocurrency market more generally, where they are a key piece of market infrastructure. As we have noted in the past, because most trading in BTC, ETH and other major tokens occurs offshore on exchanges that frequently do not</span></p>
