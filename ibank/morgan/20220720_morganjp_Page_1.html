<p><span class="font3">With SEZ removed from export taxes, RIL's refining business broadly back to normal, we expect GRMs to improve</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">The removal of SEZ from the export taxes in our view normalizes RIL's refinery operations and removes the earnings risk on the O2C business that had built post the imposition of the taxes. While benchmark GRMs have come off sharply in the last two weeks, given underlying tight balances and still steady demand, we expect benchmark GRMs to improve from here. RIL reports earnings on luly 22nd.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many tax cuts the SEZ removal from export taxes is the most positive for RIL: Post the imposition of the windfall taxes, </span><span class="font7">in its first revision, the government has lowered taxes imposed on diesel/ATF by $6/4/bbl to $20/8/bbl, with complete removal of taxes on gasoline. Importantly the government has also removed the windfall export taxes from the SEZ refineries. We believe, the majority of the company's product exports are from its lamnagar-SEZ unit.</span></p>

<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Positive for Reliance with GRM impact on the existing taxes minimal: </span><span class="font7">RIL has two refineries, of which one is an export-oriented unit (EoU). Based on FYI9 Ministry of Petrol production data, the EoU refinery unit accounted for 58% of total production and the domestic refinery accounted for 42% of production. Overall, the EoU refinery is more diesel-oriented vs the domestic refinery. </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">We believe most of RIL's product exports take place from the SEZ refinery. While there would still be some residual exports from the domestic refinery which would have to pay the ~$20/bbl tax, overall we estimate the impact on RIL's GRMs to be less than $2/bbl (and possibly even lower). </span><span class="font7">Our earnings estimates for RIL are based on realized GRMs of ~$18.5/bbl for FY23 and $12.5/bbl for FY24 and on spot cracks, product discounts, and the new export tax, the realized GRMs for RIL should be in line with our forecasts.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Benchmark refining margins have come off sharply; given underlying tightness we expect some rebound: </span><span class="font7">Since the imposition of taxes on 1st luly '22, Brent prices are down $7.5/bbl (6%) to $107/bbl, with ATF/diesel cracks down $7.2/$9.8/bbl (18-21%) to $32.2/36.1, respectively. Gasoline cracks have come off the most (owing to signs of cracks in summer season demand in the US) by 65%, bringing it down to $15.7/bbl (slightly above its long-term average). </span><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">For RIL, diesel is the most important part of the slate, and we expect diesel cracks to remain firm, given the underlying tightness in product balances.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font8" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IQ to be strong driven entirely by O2C; while diesel export tax will effectively prevent a further increase in O2C earnings from IQ levels, a collapse in earnings is unlikely if crack spreads stabilize</span></p></li></ul>
