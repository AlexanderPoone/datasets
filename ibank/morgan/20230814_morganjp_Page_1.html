<p><span class="font7">With 92% of the votes counted, the big surprise of the night was the showing of La Libertad Avanza led by libertarian Milei, winning about 30.3% of the votes (well above the 19.3% average vote intention suggested by the latest polls). Milei came to be the most voted candidate in 16 out of 24 provinces, with an outstanding performance in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Mendoza. Meanwhile, both Juntos por el Cambio and Union por la Patria coalitions disappointed expectations, with 28.3% and 27.1% of the votes, respectively. Regarding the Juntos por el Cambio primary, Bullrich defeated Larreta by a 6%-pt margin, with Larreta being the main underperformer of the night getting only 11% of the votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7">Another key result was the Province of Buenos Aires (PBA), as it represents 37% of the national vote. In this case, Union por la Patria (Kicillof) won with 36.4% of the votes, followed by Juntos por el Cambio coalition with 33% (a very close run in between Grindetti and Santilli). Milei’s candidate Piparo received 23.8% of the votes. Finally, it’s worth noting that the participation rate came at 69.5%, a bit above that of 2021 which came ata low 67% likely impacted by Covid-19, though still well below the primaries’ historical average at 77% and the lowest participation rate for a presidential election.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The low participation may offer the traditional coalitions room to grow ahead. Participation came just a bit above that of 2021 (67%, which was likely impacted by Covid-19), butstill well below the primaries’ historical average at77%. History shows that participation rate usually increases between the primaries and the general elections by about 4%-pt on average. That said, given the historically low participation rate and the strong underperformance of Massa and Larreta vis-à-vis polls (by about 4%-pt each), it seems fair to assume that participation rate could grow even higher than that observed on average. Against this backdrop, a higher turnover rate in the general elections could favor Juntos por el Cambio and Union Por la Patria, suggesting higher upside for traditional parties in the general elections as compared to Milei, which we see closer to its ceiling in terms of vote intention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font7">The surge in popularity of Milei (Libertad Avanza) juxtaposed with the lackluster perform ance of both Juntos por el Cam bio (Bullrich) and the governm ent coalition Unidad por la Patria (Massa) indicates a forthcoming period of heightened uncertainty. As we navigate this landscape, several key factors com e into play. First and foremost, we anticipate mounting pressures on the exchange rate, resulting in</span></p>
