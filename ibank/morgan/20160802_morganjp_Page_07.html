<h4><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font3"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Share price analysis</span></h4>
<p><span class="font5">CP’s shares were first listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in 1994 when the company's principal business was container leasing. Since then, the company has narrowed down its business focus through non-core divestments while expanding its container terminal operations. The company ultimately transformed into a pure-port operator after the merger of the China Shipping and COSCO Groups resulted in a reshuffling of assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Like its peers, CP’s shares got de rated during the global financial crisis beginning in Iate-2007/earIy-2008 before bottoming out in Iate-2008, losing over 80% of its value compared to the beginning of 2007. </span><span class="font5">The company’s shares then rallied c400% between 3Q08 and 1Q11 as CP continued to expand its ports business through a mixture of both international and domestic investments while also beginning to sharpen its business focus through disposal of its logistics business.</span></p>
