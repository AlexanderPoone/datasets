<p><span class="font3">since mid-2013 (which is close to when CP disposed of its container manufacturing segment resulting in the company’s business narrowing down to just container leasing and terminal operations), is that the container leasing segment started to weaken beginning in 2H13 as the industry environment began to deteriorate resulting in lower yields and container prices. Thus, during this period, the container leasing business acted as a key drag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">That said, with the recent restructuring, we believe CP should at least recover some of this underperformance, </span><span class="font3">which currently sits at c50% against the global peer group and c30% against CMHI using Jan 2009 as the base, given the leasing business drag has been removed. We believe this will be driven by the de-cluttered business structure where the terminals segment is expected to drive stable core earnings growth while the company's FCF profile is expected to improve in the coming few years with FCF yield rising to 9%~10% after FYI7 (capex is forecast to rise in the next two years as the company accelerates its overseas acquisition program). Furthermore, we believe expectations have now realigned with the current lower growth market environment and see limited downside catalysts in the near-term.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Looking at the company’s historical valuation band charts below, it would appear that the stock's current valuation is not at particularly low levels. That said, CP has been adjusting its business focus over this period of time while slowly developing its now core terminal operations business. Thus, historical valuation trends may not necessarily be representative of how the stock should be valued going forward, especially given the company was only recently able to shed its remaining nonterminals segment.</span></p>
