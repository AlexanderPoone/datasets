<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Cash flow indicators</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In light of the cash-generative nature of ports operations, we anticipate operating cash efficiency to improve off of last year's low base after the container leasing assets were swapped out for CSPD's ports portfolio. We note that CP’s operating cash flow to sales ratio declined between 2013 and 2015, which we believe can be attributable to the poor performance of the container leasing business resulting in margin and profit erosion driven by falling rental yields and low container prices. However, with the recent restructuring, we forecast CP's ability to convert revenue into cash to improve in FY16E and remain at high levels of c60% going forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We are expecting CP to be more aggressive in terms of acquisitions over the next couple of years. </span><span class="font4">As such, we anticipate CP will have to gear-up as adjusted operating cash flows (consolidate OCF plus dividends received from JCEs and associates) will not be able to cover anticipated capex with coverage falling to 0.6x in FY16E before rising back up to &gt;lx. But since CP’s gearing has come down over the past few years (in fact, post-merger, CP’s gearing would have declined further given the disposed container leasing business had higher leverage), we believe CP's operations will be able to support higher debt levels without the need for equity issuances.</span></p>
