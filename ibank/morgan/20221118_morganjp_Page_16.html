<p><span class="font4">High-yield bond prices rose $1.88 in October and spreads tightened by the most since July, 72bp. As such, the sub-$50 and 1000bp+ universe of distressed bonds came down off a high since 2Q20 and are commensurate with 4Q19’s prepandemic levels. The sub-$70 universe of bonds rose by the most since January 2016 aside from March 2020 and has increased 8-fold YTD. And given the surge in rates, the sub-$90 universe is at a high since 2008’s GFC. More specifically, the volume of bonds trading at or below $70 decreased by $13.6bn m/m to $117.8bn or 8.6% of the non-defaulted universe. For context, the distressed universe stood at $24bn at year-end 2020, $75bn in Feb-20 (pre-pandemic) and reached $226bn in Mar-20. Healthcare bonds account for 21% of bonds trading at or below $70, which is followed by Financial (10%) and</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Gaming/Lodging/Leisure (9%). Retail’s 21.3% of total outstanding is trading below $70, followed by Healthcare’s 19.4%, and Broadcasting’s 17.5%. Meanwhile, the universe of bonds trading sub-$50 also decreased for the first time since January. Specifically, sub-$50 universe decreased by $1.2bn m/m to $35.8bn (or 2.6% universe) versus $42bn before 2020’s recession. Note accounting for 60% of the sub-$50 universe are NEWLSQ, DSPORT, BHCCN, CYH, and CVNA. Meanwhile, the par amount of high-yield bonds trading at or below $90 increased by $154bn m/m to $750bn, or 54.7% of the non-defaulted universe. This is now well above the $534bn or 40.9% of the HY universe, which traded sub-$90 in March 2020</span></p>
