<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">UPDATE</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">some. </span><span class="font0">We continue to expect that market conviction in the timing of a sustainable cross-border travel return, likely as a result of an improved macroeconomic outlook, will be a key positive stock catalyst for V and MA. Despite continued healthy volume trends, we acknowledge that uncertainty remains on the travel outlook heading into 2023 given concerns around recession risk, inflation, and normalizing consumer credit coinciding with a potential moderation in postpandemic travel demand. For now, we think travel momentum appears resilient based on data we track, reopenings in Asia, and positive commentary from airlines related to bookings/demand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Tracking the travel recovery. </span><span class="font0">We monitor several key data sources to get a pulse on how travel trends and consumer bookings are evolving. These include 1) The ITA and Department of Homeland Security's I-92 monitor for US Citizen departures by region and non-US citizen arrivals by region, 2) US TSA passenger throughput data, 3) Heathrow airport passenger traffic by market served, 4) Asia-Pac passenger traffic data across Hong Kong International, Japan's Narita and Kansai airports, Singapore's Changi airport, and the top 20 Australian airports, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">5) </span><span class="font0">cross-border flight seat capacity expectations, 6) mgmt commentary from airline companies, 7) IATA's revenue passenger kilometers by region, and 8) hotel occupancy data across regions. Our findings around each of these are outlined in the sections below and in Exhibits 1-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">What does the travel recovery mean for numbers? </span><span class="font0">Based on our estimates, we think a recovery in Asia-Pac travel spend volume from 76% of 2019 Levels (most recent disclosures by V/MA) to 100% could benefit Visa's '23 EPS by ~2%. Meanwhile, a more complete global cross-border travel recovery from 120% of 2019 Levels to 150% (implies a Low double digit CAGR since 2019) could benefit EPS by ~7%. We think these travel recoveries would Likely benefit V/MA stocks by even more, as we would expect multiples to expand as it removes what we believe to be an ongoing overhang related to uncertainty around travel's resiliency. Historically, V/MA have traded at an average P/E multiple of 25x/27x, and with current '24 multiples now at 21x/23x,we would expect this gap to narrow in the event of a more complete recovery (Exhibits 9-10).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Remain OW. </span><span class="font0">We are encouraged by recent border opening developments and positive commentary from banks and airlines around travel demand and bookings, which we think is well supported by the data we track around flights, airports, and hotels. We remain OW V and MA as we continue to expect that market conviction in the timing of a sustainable cross-border travel return resulting from an improved macro outlook will be a key positive catalyst for the stocks.</span></p>
