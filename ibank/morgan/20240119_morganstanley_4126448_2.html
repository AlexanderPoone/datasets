<p><span class="font2">In early 2022, the Fed Laid out its plans for quantitative tightening (QT) (see here and here). Those plans were to run down the balance sheet, reducing assets by $60bn Treasuries per month and up to $35bn MBS per month, and at some point to be determined in the future, the Fed planned to slow that pace of runoff. Finally, before getting all the way to &quot;ample&quot; reserves, it would stop QT. Since then, Fed officials have reiterated that plan over time (see here and here, for examples from 2023). Despite the rise in market discussion of QT recently, we think there is only limited new information. Consequently, our view has evolved, but only modestly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We had said the Fed would taper QT beginning September of this year and end QT February next year. We now expect that over the next three FOMC meetings, the Fed will discuss QT in detail and then announce the size and magnitude of the taper in May. For now, we pencil in a starting date of June and a shift to $30bn per month in Treasury QT, but no change to MBS. After that shift, we continue to see QT running through the end of this year, and ending February 2025, although that outcome is subject to uncertainty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The market narrative following recent Fed communication has contemplated an imminent end to QT, which we believe is overdone. It was always the case that the taper in QT would happen in 2024. The minutes to the December 2023 FOMC meeting noted that the Committee might begin to discuss conditions for the taper of QT before Long. But as of December, those discussions had not begun, and indeed the discussions concerned tapering, not ending QT. Moreover, the minutes said that the Committee would make decisions and communicate &quot;well before&quot; it happened so that markets would have a great deal of advanced notice. In the past, such discussions have taken place over a couple of meetings, implying that the earliest taper announcement would seem to be at the May meeting, following discussions in January and March. A May announcement could indicate taper to begin June 1, a risk to our baseline view.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hints about the conditions for a taper came in speeches from Fed officials, most clearly from President Logan and Governor Waller. President Logan (who previously ran the SOMA Portfolio at the New York Fed) expressed a preference for the RRP facility to be drawn down to zero, and Linked getting very close to that Level as a time to taper QT. Governor Waller also said Last year that draining the RRP facility was an objective and recently he said at Brookings on January 16, &quot;there's no reason to have anything in it,&quot; he said at Brookings and then re-emphasized that getting to that point could prompt a taper. In our baseline, the RRP facility will be roughly $250bn at the time of the May or June FOMC meeting, and thus would be a natural point to announce a taper in QT. Even if the RRP falls more rapidly than we expect, the result would be a higher Level of reserves, given that the Fed's balance sheet would have to balance. Consequently, even an earlier draining of the RRP and a possible earlier taper would not imply an earlier end to QT.</span></p>
