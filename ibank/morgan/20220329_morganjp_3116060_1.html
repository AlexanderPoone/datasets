<p><span class="font6">With geopolitical and macro risks elevated, </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">we see Healthcare as </span><span class="font6">one </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">of the few equity segments offering earnings stability and capital return at a still favorable valuation. </span><span class="font6">We entered this year with an overweight on Healthcare and maintain this view given the sector continues to offer a rare combination of Quality, Low Vol, Growth and Value. This report is a joint effort between Equity Macro Strategy and Healthcare Research teams, and includes investment theses for all major Healthcare sub-sectors along with two baskets based on JPM stock analysts’ views: (1) </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JPM Healthcare Franchise </span><span class="font6">(JPAMHFRA) is a higher Quality basket expected to outperform S&amp;P 500 Healthcare sector, and (2) </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">JPM Healthcare Innovation </span><span class="font6">(JPAMHINO) is a higher Growth basket with attractive long-term risk/reward especially given its recent shaip underperformance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">We see Healthcare as a safe-haven in a world with elevated geopolitical risks, high inflation, and decelerating global growth. </span><span class="font6">It offers defensive growth (inelastic-demand / secular growth even through periods of uncertainty), high margins and pricing power (offset inflation), and attractive shareholder yield (3.1% vs. lOyr rate of 2.5%) at a reasonable valuation (~16x vs. ~20x S&amp;P 500). After an average -54% drawdown for Russell 3000 Healthcare constituents with -24% of stocks down more than 80% over the past year, we see Healthcare investor sentiment as poor and washed out. These declines have been far worse than the average drawdown of -25% across markets due to Healthcare’s higher exposure to early-stage stocks (-23% of Russell 3000 Healthcare have little or no trailing revenues vs. ~1% for Russell 3000 exHealthcare). In our view, the </span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">aggressive Fed Pivot</span><span class="font6"> in recent months (from 2 rate hikes to 8) has been a key catalyst for the boom and bust of growth names within the sector. Equity capital market activity for Healthcare, specifically for higher-beta sub-sectors, have come to a relative standstill (~$18B annualized pace) compared to recent years (2020: ~$77B, 2021: ~$51B). While the outlook for the healthcare innovation cycle remains unchanged, investor enthusiasm has clearly waned, leaving </span><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">sector valuations at cheapest levels in years </span><span class="font6">(S&amp;P 500 Healthcare is trading at -4x relative to market vs. historical premium of ~lx), cheaper than its defensive peers (-5x relative to Staples and Utilities) and much cheaper than its growth peers (-9x relative to Tech). On the hyper-growth side, S&amp;P Biotech collapsed by -44% relative to the market from 52W highs representing the largest undeiperformance on record and even below previous cycle lows (e.g. 2009-10, 2015-16, see Figure 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Healthcare has been in secular growth for several decades due to positive demographics (ageing and growing middle-class population), which we believe is unique to this sector. In the US alone, Healthcare expenditures have risen to 16% of total personal consumption wallet from 5% since the 1950s, while Food and Beverages has declined to 8% from 21%. This has translated to Healthcare generating the strongest revenue growth by far of all sectors since the GFC of 9.0% CAGR (vs. 4.4% S&amp;P 500) and long-term growth rate of 10.6% CAGR (vs. 4.0% S&amp;P 500 since 1994), see Figure 3. While rising energy and inflation costs could be a concern for crowding out healthcare spending in the short term, demographic trends, excess savings, and rising wages all suggest otherwise. Based on consensus estimates, Healthcare is expected to generate healthy mid-single-digit revenue growth this year and next. As for pricing power, Healthcare enjoys tech-like margins outside of Services and much higher than Defensive peers. Most Healthcare industries earn margins north of 20% given patent protection and scale while Biotech (38%) and Pharma (30%) generate among the strongest margins of all S&amp;P 500 industries (in line</span></p>
