<p><span class="font3">As part of the merger between China Shipping Group and COSCO Group, the port operations of the two groups were consolidated into COSCO Pacific. The transaction allowed CP to offload its container leasing business, helping CP transform into a pure port operator. Overall, we view this move as positive for CP given the company has been streamlining its business scope over the past few years with multiple divestitures of non-core businesses with the China Shipping/COSCO merger being the final step. Furthermore, we believe CP may benefit from several sources of positive synergies while also seeing greater throughput volume stability/support from the merged container shipping operations of COSCO and China Shipping.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Transformation into pure terminal operator a long-time coming and could help unlock value</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">CP has been proactive in its efforts to narrow its business focus in recent years including two key divestments of non-core businesses: disposal of CP's logistics business in 2009 and container manufacturing segment in 2013. However, over the last couple of years, we believe CP's share price has been discounted given the prior dual-segment focus of port operations and container leasing, the latter of which has been struggling in the current operating environment that has seen overcapacity from the shipping liners and falling raw material prices result in lower rental yields as well as second hand box prices with pressures unlikely to ease substantially in the near-term. Hence, we anticipate the disposal of Florens Container Holdings (FCHL), CP's prior leasing division, to potentially help CP unlock some value (prior to restructuring, CP was trading at 0.6x P/B, substantially lower than peers like CMHI which was at closer to lx P/B).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Impact of COSCO/China Shipping merger - CP comes out the other side leaner, but near term profitability may be diluted</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In early August 2015, it was reported that the Chinese government had asked the China Shipping Group and COSCO Group to draft a merger plan, resulting in all the relevant stocks under the two groups to suspend trading. Initial information focused on the consolidation of shipping operations, but it was always a likely scenario that a merging of the two groups' port operations would be a part of the overall plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In the end, there was a large scale reshuffling of assets between the two groups w hich included the injection of China Shipping’s port assets held under China Shipping Port Development (&quot;CSPD&quot;) into CP while CP would dispose of FCHL. </span><span class="font3">With respect to valuation, on a historical P/B basis, the valuations of the two assets were clx for the outbound asset and 1,2x 2014 P/B for the inbound asset. Looking at the transaction from a P/E perspective, however, shows that the acquisition appears to be substantially more expensive, which resulted in some push back from investors.</span></p>
