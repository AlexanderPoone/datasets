<p><span class="font2">the relatively affluent (top 20%) while the middle class (top 20%-60%) real liqu idity is back to pre-Covid level and the bottom 40% are worse off.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geopolitical and political risks remain high, with an ongoing shift to a multipolar world order, two major wars, and 40 countries holding national elections (including the US) that could add policy volatility, see </span><span class="font2" style="text-decoration:underline;">Geopolitical tectonic shifts</span><span class="font2">. As such, we expect equity volatility to generally trade higher in 2024 than in 2023, and the extent of the increase depends on the timing and severity of an eventual recession.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consensus estimates and equity valuation imply growth acceleration consistent with an intra-cycle / early-cycle recovery. The market is assuming a near perfect landing with inflation cooling without a significant impact to demand and pricingpower — not likely in our view. Consensus forward EPS growth of 11% for US and 9% for AC MSCI ex-US is in harmony with this Goldilocks outlook, which does not consider Higher for Longer or a recession outcome depending on course ofpolicy actions and geopolitical developments. In contrast to this robust outlook, we expect lower sequential revenue growth, no margin expansion, and lower buyback executions.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Current valuation is rich, especially in light of the aging business cycle, restrictive monetary policy, and geopolitical risks. S&amp;P 500 multiple relative to real rates is overvalued by ~3x (or ~4x if post-Covid stimulus and TMT bubble episodes are excluded), Equity Risk Premia (ERP) is at 96%ile since 2010, i.e. very low reward for the risk (Figure 20). Traditional valuation metrics are similarly in the richest deciles with EV/EBITDAof 14x(90%ile), EV/Sales of2.7x (88%ile), and P/Bof4.3x(89%ile). At this valuation and VIX near historical low, the market is farfrom appreciating the known risks (e.g. CRE, rising bankruptcies, credit delinquencies) and unknown unknowns (i.e. unwinding of cany trades implemented during -15 years of ZIRP).</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are increasing signs of caution emerging. Credit card delinquencies continue to rise. Office CRE trends continue to weaken with a wall of maturities looming in ^4. Syndicated leveraged loan defaults are well above jl 9 levels and rising. All of this adds up and suggests a credit cycle that is running a little long in the tooth. Also, venture-backed companies are facing sharp tighteningwith 3Q23 LTM investments activity down -33% y/y and -53% from the peak.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font2">Cross-Regional Equity Strategy. US continues to command a quality premium over other markets given its sector composition and cash rich mega-cap stocks. If the economic growth momentum of this year continues into 2024, it is likely that the US will underperform given the wide valuations gapofthe US vs other regions, and its rich investorpositioning. However, if the expected Goldilocks environment does not materialize, a risk we believe is under-appreciated, the US will likely outperform in an otherwise disappointing global equity performance in 2024.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the US and within international developed markets, we are relatively more optimistic on UK equities given significant valuation support and favorable sector compositions. Despite cheap valuation, we expect European equities to have a v-shaped path (weak 1H and then some recovery on Fed rate cuts) ending the year relatively flat (this assumes no recession in 2024). On the other hand, Japan remains attractive with a potential pick-up in retail participation, strong balance sheets, improving shareholder focus, better consumer real income growth and still supportive policy backdrop.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect a bumpy start to the year for Emergi ng Markets given high rates, geopolitical developments, lasting USD strength and poor historical EM Sharpe ratio versus DM. However EM should become more attractive through 2024 on EM-DM growth divergence, demand for diversification away from the US, low investorpositioning, steep discount to DM and USD weakness. For Chi na, which has lagged meaningfully tliis year, there is a prospect of betterperformance if the growth momentum delivers on the upside, and the geopolitical risks stay contained. We see a more positive setup for Latam equities</span></p>
