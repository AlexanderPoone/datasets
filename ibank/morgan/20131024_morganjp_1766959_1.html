<h5><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font5"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Another West Kowloon project, Long Beach, offering a discount; SHKP remains a value play</span></h5>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Three projects in West Kowloon for sale in the next three days: </span><span class="font7">The coming three days will be busy days for property agents in HK and potential buyers for West Kowloon projects. Three primary projects will be available for sale: The Cullinan of SHKP on 25 October (Friday), The Austin of NWD/Wheelock on 26 October (Saturday) and The Long Beach of Hang Lung on 27 October (Sunday).</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cullinan is the most expensive one: </span><span class="font7">Among the three projects, Cullinan has the highest price tag (estimated effective price at HK$28,649 psf for the fourth batch, vs HK$20,800 psf for Austin and HK$13,210 psf for Long Beach) which is reasonable given its location right above Kowloon Station. Yet the effective average price of the latest batch is still 13% below the average transaction price of HK$32,780 psf in the secondary market in 2013 after a few rounds of price increases. The average prices of the two other projects, after discount, are similar to the secondary market price. Comparison of the three projects is in Table 1.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">Maximum discount of 18% for Long Beach re-launch: </span><span class="font7">After holding the remaining units of Long Beach for some years after completion, Hang Lung released the price list of 366 units yesterday, of which 40 units will be available for sale this Sunday. The majority of these units are three-bedroom units and have a sea view, hence the average price of these units after the maximum discount of 18% is not at a big discount to the secondary market price (HK$13,210 psf vs HK$ 13,640 psf). We estimate that the average price after discount for a two-bedroom unit is around HK$ 12,608 psf, about 6% lower than the secondary market price.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First come, first served may create an overnight queue: </span><span class="font7">Unlike other developers, Hang Lung is not offering a subsidy for stamp duty. Instead, the special discount amount is higher than that of the others. Besides, Hang Lung does not apply balloting to determine the order of priority for sales. They will apply a first come, first served methodology, which we think might result in an overnight queue outside the sales office.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Valuation of SHKP remains attractive in the long-run: So </span><span class="font7">far, the market reaction to the primary launches is quite neutral. Despite SHKP receiving a strong sales response for Cullinan and managing to raise prices, the SHKP share price dropped slightly after the re-launch, bi the short-term, a good sales response is unlikely to be a driver. However, for long-term value investors, the valuation of SHKP remains attractive. The stock is trading at 0.7x FYI3 P/B, compared with long-term average of 1.16x.</span></p>
