<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top-down view is for L SD to be bu mpy bu t elevated. Preference is to buy on dips, but be tactical as markets vacillate between US exceptionalism and recession, narrowing the valley of the smile.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sustained USD weakness will require Fed cuts and better growth outside the US. Both conditions are not met yet.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Central banks will move to synchronized rate cuts. USD impact will depend on the cyclical context, but size, sequencing and natu re of cuts (“good” vs. “bad”) should generate ample RV opportunities.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20 23 was the golden year for FX carry; 202 4 should be the beginning of the end as high-yielders cut most. Declining yields will make cany less attractive and a narrower theme.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recession risk is well priced into low-yielding, GIO high beta FX, but not among high-yielders. Look for some convergence as yields compress.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US elections will come into view next year. If current polling persists, USD risks are skewed to the upside as the market processes the possibility' of new tariffs.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We discuss FX in different macro scenarios; Soft landings are not always USD bearish.</span></p></li>

<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;China growth upgrades amid soggy' global growth do not tend to deliver large, durable commodity' FX gains</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font6">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baseline looks for the USD TWI to strengthen by 25% in 1H24; EUR/USD 1.00-1.05 in 1H; USD/CNH 7.30-7.35, GIO high beta ex-XZD to strengthen, but EMCI to weaken 6% in spot (+1% total).</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font3">2023: The golden year for FX carry</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">In our 2023 outlook </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">This isn't over</span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">,</span><span class="font6"> our baseline was for renewed USD strength on the premise that a Fed pause by itself wouldn't be sufficient for USD weakness; the latter would require sustained global growth. The USD strength we envisioned was one of lower magnitude given rich valuations and of a different composition than in 2022 (high beta FX was expected to bear the brunt of slowing growth). Key macro components to the view were (a) central banks moving to a synchronized high-hold with ongoing QT and (b) late-cycle dynamics with US recession probabilities rising. The view on both euro and renminbi was downbeat: on EUR because of poor carry, still-elevated energy prices, little visibility into severity of the impending winter and longer-term ramifications of the Russian invasion; and on CNY because the path to post-COVID normalization was envisioned to be bumpy</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">with medium-term BoP dynamics skewed to the downside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">A year-on, we got that renewed USD strength, but amid different circumstances. The Fed hiked more than anticipated, US growth was more resilient, and the growth upturn in China/ Eurozone on an abrupt COVID re-opening / slide in energy prices was sharp but ran out of steam by mid-year. What transpired then was a range-bound USD index in 1H, followed by US-exceptionalism driven dollar strength in 2H.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Some might look at the 6% peak-to-trough range in 2023 for the dollar index and conclude that the year was devoid of action in FX. In reality, this couldn’t be further from the truth. 2023 will be a year re membered for many things, but for FX market participants it shall forever be known as the golden year for cany. Global nominal carry baskets regardless of construction delivered 20% or higher returns in 2023, a record as investors sought out the widest global yield dispersion in nearly two decades amid resilient growth. Relative changes in interest rates and carry emerged as among the biggest drivers of FX returns in GIO as well (Figure 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Lessons learnt in 2023</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">First, wide yield dispersion (i.e. yield gap between high and low y¡elders) should be respected, particularly when one can earn carry while neutralizing beta. Growth stability during such periods manifests in positive returns from carry rather than lower-yielding growth outperformed. The distribution of YTD returns suggests that once markets can predict lower yields, investors are likely to shy away from carry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Second, when the dollar (or a defensive cu rrency) is yielding more than high beta currencies, it strengthens by vir-</span></p>
