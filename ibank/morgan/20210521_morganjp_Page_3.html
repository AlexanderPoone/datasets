<p><span class="font5">The composition of those reserve assets has always been somewhat opaque. Most disclosure allows for bank deposits as well as other “approved” investments which are not specified. </span><span class="font4">Last week, however, in their effort to broadcast commitment to transparency, the largest stablecoin issuer, Tether, provided </span><span class="font4" style="text-decoration:underline;">some details</span><span class="font4"> on the asset allocation of their reserve holdings. </span><span class="font5">Interestingly, the vast majority of their holdings as of late-March were held in money market instruments (-75%), primarily commercial paper (-50% of the total, 65% of cash and equivalents) rather than deposits (18% and 24%). If we assume that composition stayed roughly the same in the subsequent few months, it suggests that the Tether reserve fund is a larger holder of commercial paper (~$29bn) than most prime money market funds </span><span class="font4">(Exhibit 3) </span><span class="font5">as well as large corporates like AAPL, AMZN, GOOG and others.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">Is the Tether reserve simply invested in prime MMFs directly? </span><span class="font5">Recent disclosure does not indicate the format in which their assets are held. It is worth noting, however, that their allocation is quite different from the prime MMF complex as a whole (see </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">JPM Mid-Week US Short Duration Update,</span><span class="font5"> T. Ho &amp;&nbsp;A. Roe ver, 4/15/21), which had roughly 32% of total AUM in T-Bills (20%) and repo (12%) as of March month-end, compared to ~7% in the Tether reserve (2.9% and 3.6%). </span><span class="font4">That said they could be managed directly or by a third party in a separately managed account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Whether the allocation of the Tether reserve is representative of other, smaller stablecoins is unknown. A key question is why they would choose to rely more heavily on commercial paper, which brings with it more logistical and relative value considerations around credit and maturity than comparatively simpler bank deposits. </span><span class="font4">There are three reasons in particular to believe Tether has and will continue to face difficulty accessing the domestic banking system—particularly at the scale required to absorb a meaningful fraction of their already sizeable reserve funds First, </span><span class="font5">their holdings are likely offshore, and not necessarily in the Bahamas.</span></p>
