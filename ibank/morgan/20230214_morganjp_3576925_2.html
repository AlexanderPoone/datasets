<p><span class="font3">We recommend investors re-load long exposure to KOSPI2 volatility via FVA after months of declines in equity implied volatility. We attribute the recent weakness in equity implied volatility to optimism on a dovish pivot in central bank rate policies and reduction in China/EM Asia market risk premium. We think both factors have likely run its course. While shorter dated volatility appears cheaper to buy, we remain wary of a lack of realized volatility as equity markets remain in the process of finding a clear direction. We prefer FVA to position for a potential reset higher in longer dated implied volatility. Apart from the macro-economic considerations, the case of buying KOSPI 200 FVA is strong given attractive entry levels, imbalanced vega supply demand dynamics in favor of FVA buyers and country specific catalysts. We recommend investors buying KOSPI2 Dec23 - Dec24 325 FVA swaddle.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">A dovish expectation of central bank rate policies is at a tn ruing point. </span><span class="font3">Since end-Oct 2022, Asia and global equity implied volatility reset lower in response to expectation of a dovish pivot in central bank policies (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Moves in equity 1Y ATM implied volatility tracked market expectation of policy rates over the medium term. The shift in market expectations from rate hikes to rate cuts was subsequently followed by a shaip downturn in SPX and KOSPI2 1Y ATMS implied volatility. The combination of hawkish central bank comments and resilient US labor market data suggests the optimism on potential rate cuts towards the end of this year is premature. Latest reading on the market implied change in Fed Rinds rate and BoK policy rates in the next 3 to 12 months are signs that the speculative expectation of rate cuts is abating. This should provide support to long volatility strategies, in our view.</span></p>
