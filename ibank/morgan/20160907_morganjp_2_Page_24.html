<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Sinopharm </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Neutral; Price Target: HK$44.00)</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Investment Thesis</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Sinopharm was established in 2003 and is the largest pharmaceutical distributor in China, with an ~18% market share. Products are sold directly to hospitals or through local third-party distributors. Sinopharm also has small drug retailing and manufacturing operations. Sinopharm has established a distribution network in all provinces of China and should stand to benefit from higher GSP [Good Supply Standard ] standards and expected industry consolidation. In the near term, we see potential for economies of scale and leveraging. In the long run, we believe it may become a logistics company providing solutions to hospitals and other distributors..</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark4"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark5"></a>Valuation</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Our Dec-17 price target of HK$44.0 is based on a DCF valuation which assumes a market premium of 6.0% and a risk-free rate of 4.2% (yield on ten-year government notes in China). We assume a beta of 0.80 based on regression analysis performed by Bloomberg. Typically, pharmaceutical distribution is a stable business and leading US distributors have a similarly low beta of 0.8. Accordingly, we assume a WACC of 10.3%. We estimate free cash flow for Sinopharm until 2020 and assume a terminal growth rate of 4.0%.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark6"></a><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark7"></a>Risks to Rating and Price Target</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Key downside risks to our rating and PT include a slower pace of acquisition of new distributors and a faster pick-up in sales volume arising from the implementation of the Essential Drug List, resulting in low points taken by Sinopharm because of low profitability to manufacturers as it requires profit-sharing with distributors. In addition, we see risks from: 1) an unexpected industry-wide slowdown; 2) acquisitions becoming prohibitively expensive; and 3) finance costs staying high for longer than expected.</span></p>
