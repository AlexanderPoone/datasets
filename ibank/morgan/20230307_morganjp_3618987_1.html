<p><span class="font6">Results season thus far has been underwhelming for Indonesian consumer companies under coverage. SIDO’s resultwasin-line(link) while UNVRreported a weak 4Q (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font6">). We expect upcoming results for companies under coverage to buck that trend, with ICBP, HMSP and MAPI expected to deliver strong 4Q results at the end of the month. Our expectation of strong results is mostly bottom-up driven, as companies and industry performance re main polarized at this junction. We expect results to be the strongest for MAPI as 4Q is seasonally the strongest for the company and this is the first holiday season where footfall to shopping malls is unrestricted. For ICBP, we expect results to be strong driven by normalization of input cost, as well as strong Middle-East performance. We are cognizant of Pinehill’s issues in Egypt, but we expect profitability of the Saudi business to outweigh the negative impact from Egypt. For HMSP, we saw price hikes in 4Q which should significantly drive margins upwards. Our top picks in the sector are ICBP, HMSP, MAPI and GGRM.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Use recent weakness to accu initiate ICBP. </span><span class="font6">ICBP’s share price has been subpar this year (in line with the index), likely on fears that Egypt will drag down overall Pinehill performance. Egypt is a sizeable market for Pinehill and its currency depreciated 26% y/y in 4Q due to high inflation (</span><span class="font6" style="text-decoration:underline;">link to Egypt’s inflation repor</span><span class="font6">t). We however believe that Egypt’s impact on profitability is trivial (estimated at 3-5% to ICBP’s total profit) and the impact of lower commodity price (wheat and CPO) will outweigh Egypt’s negative results. In addition, headline earnings might look disappointing as IDR depreciated 2.2% against USD in 4Q, resulting in FX-losses of ICBP’s USD bond holding. These losses could be reversed in 1Q23 as IDR has appreciated 1% against USD ytd. We would urge investors to focus on EBIT and core-profit ex FX, and we believe both will likely beat expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Cigarettes price increase will lead to multiple quarters of earnings beat. </span><span class="font6">Our channel checks on the ground indicated that leading players (HMSP and GGRM) have increased prices in Dec-22 and Jan-23. Some products also saw price hikes in Feb-23, and we believe this will setup for strong beats in 4Q22 and 1Q23 results. With a more manageable excise tax hike in 202 3 and 2024, we believe cigarette companies profitability will significantly improve in the upcoming two years and the current price is not reflective of that in our view. We believe that beats will be more prominent for HMSP in the 4Q22 result, but GGRM will likely report strong 1Q23 results following price hikes in Dec-22 and Jan-23.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">MAPI remains solid, expect a not her strong quarterbefore earnings reset. We </span><span class="font6">expect another strong quarter for MAPI, backed by strong footfalls at shopping malls during the holiday season and a relatively healthy inventory level, enabling MAPI to push through the quarter with minimum discounts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">Notable ownership and earnings upgrade/downgrade trends. </span><span class="font6">Notable movements in ownership trends include: 1) foreign selling in both GGRM and HMSP, while domestic institutional investors are buying; 2) foreign investors</span></p>
