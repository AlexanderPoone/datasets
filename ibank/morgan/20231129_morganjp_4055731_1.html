<p><span class="font4">2024 Global Equity Outlook</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">Since the start of the rate hike cycle in 2022, regional business cycles have weakened, earnings growth has stagnated (S&amp;P 500 2021-2024E EPS :$208-$225, -2.5% CAGR), and the market has moved sideways averaging nearour price target of 4,200 (2022 avg: -4,100; 2023 avg: -4,250). Equity concentration reached levels not seen since 1970s with a very narrow leadersliip, which is typical ahead of a slowdown. Most active investors and diversified portfolios underperformed in this environment with S&amp;P 500 performance led by a small number of mega-cap stocks (Magnificent 7 +101% vs. S&amp;P 500 equal weight +3.5%, Russell 2000 +2.3%, Defensive sectors -11%, 46% of S&amp;P 1500 stocks down YTD). Many argue the next leg up for global equities will be supported by laggards. However, we see this as a tall order given that underperformers are more economically sensitive with lower and vulnerable margins. After a period of record pricing power, the recent disinflationary trend should become a major headwind for corporate margins amidst sticky and lagging wage trends. In fact, pricing power could outright turn negative / deflationary in some industries. Absent rapid Fed easing, we expect a more challenging macro backdrop for stocks next year with softening consumer trends at a time when investor positioning and sentiment have mostly reversed. Equities are now richly valued with volatility nearthe histoneal low, while geopolitical and political risks remain elevated. We expect lackluster global earnings growth with downside for equities from current levels. For S&amp;P500, we estimate earnings growth of 2-3% next year with EPS of $225 and Price Target of 4,200 with a downside bias. At the style and sector levels, we recommend investors overweight Bond Proxies and Quality at a Reasonable Price with Utilities sector at a sweet spot oft his mix. While it is difficult to pindown the start date and depthofa recession ahead of time, we think it is a live risk for next year even though investors are not pricing in this uncertainty consistently across geograpliies, styles, and sectors yet.</span></p>
