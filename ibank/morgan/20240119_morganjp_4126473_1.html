<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December retail sales capped off a solid holiday shopping season, albeit with some caveats</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Housing appears to be getting a modest lift from the recent decline in mortgage rates</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with progress on inflation. Fed officials look to be in no hurry to cut rates</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font5">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next week blings the first look at 4Q GDP (2.2% saar) and December core PCE inflation (0.22%m/m)</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font5">The economic data released this week point to an economy that continues to grow at a trend-like pace around the turn of the year. A solid retail sales report for December was consistent with good growth in real consumer spending at the end of last year, which provided the anchor for what we still think looks like real GDP expanding at a 2.2% annual rate in 4Q. While the news on IQ is still scant at this point, the very low level of jobless claims in the latest weekly report suggests no deterioration in the health of the labor market. And as long as the labor market remains tight we expect consumer spending will continue to move the expansion forward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The early January housing indicators have also looked favorable, as the roughly lOObp decline in mortgage rates is having the expected effect on housing demand. The January homebuilders survey perked up and the latest weekly data on mortgage purchase applications also turned higher. To be sure, both of these indicators remain at low levels, and we expect they won’t get anywhere near recent highs absent a more substantial move down in mortgage rates. Existing home sales were more downbeat through the latest December print, but we view this as a more of a lagging signal on housing. Through the ups and downs of housing demand over the past two years, housing supply has been steadier. That was the case again in December, as housing starts slipped last month, but the more forward-looking permits data increased and single-family permits rose to the highest level since May 2022.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Manufacturing has looked less impressive. Industrial production edged up 0.1%-pt last month, thanks to returning UAW workers. But in the bigger picture the level of manufacturing output last month was virtually unchanged relative to where it was two years ago (and 10 years ago, for that matter). While manufacturing output has been boringly and disappointingly stagnant, the factory surveys have suggested an even grimmer picture for most of the last year. That was the case again this week as both the Empire State and Philly Fed manufacturing surveys for January were deeply in negative territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Compared to last week there was little inflation news this week. Next week we look for the December core PCE mea</span></p>
</div><br clear="all">
<div>
<p><span class="font5">sure to increase 0.22% month on month, which would take the year-ago reading down from 3.2% to 3.0%. While progress continues to be made in bringing core inflation back down toward the Fed’s 2% goal, Fed officials appear in no rush to cut rates. Notably, this week Fed governor Waller indicated that while policy rates can probably come down this year, the decision to lower the funds rate should be “carefully calibrated and not rushed.” We heard this as leaning against a move as soon as March and we continue to look for the first cut at the June FOMC meeting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Monetary policy hasn’t been the only show in town this week. Congress passed last-minute funding for government agencies that otherwise would have closed this weekend. The shortterm patch sets up another funding battle next month. A deal may be in the works to couple an extension of two expiring business tax benefits with a restart of the expanded child tax credit. But news headlines suggested that the two sides were further from a deal to couple Ukraine aid with border reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Next week is about numbers, not words: Fed speakers will be in their blackout period ahead of the late January FOMC meeting. Instead, attention will turn to the first look at 4Q GDP, and the December reading of the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, core PCE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Retail sales: use your illusion</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The December retail sales report beat expectations, with the headline up 0.6% in December and sales for the important control group up 0.8% that month (Figure 1). Revisions for the control group were also modestly positive for both November and October. On the whole, this report shows more momentum for consumers than we (and the consensus) had been anticipating late last year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">It now looks like real consumption rose about 0.3% in December and was up around 2.5% saar in 4Q. There are reasons to think that the underlying trend is not as strong as these numbers imply on the surface, as the increase in retail spending during the holiday season </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">was lackluster before seasonal</span></p>
