<p><span class="font2">Other key points</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine-tuning our models. </span><span class="font1">On average, we raise our 2016-18E EBITDA by 3-4% and our PTs by clO%. Key assumptions: (1) industry GGR to fall 3% in 2016E (old: -7%) and to recover 6% p.a. in 2017-18E, (2) VIP GGR to drop 12% in 2016E (old: -19%) and stabilize at +3% in 2017-18E, (3) mass GGR to grow +6% in 2016E (no change) and +8-9% p.a. in 2017-18E, (4) industry EBITDA to outgrow GGR, up 6% in 2016E and +13% p.a. in 2017-18E, driven by miximprovement and cost restructuring, (5) our PTs imply 13x 2017E EBITDA on average (rolled over from 2016E) and suggest 2-18% upside potential till Dec-16.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IQ results will likely be mixed. </span><span class="font1">Wynn’s strong IQ pre-announcement has surprised the market </span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">(link</span><span class="font1">), but we don’t expect any big beats/misses from the rest. We estimate IQ sector EBITDA to grow +3% qoq, similar to GGR growth of +2.5% qoq, as positive operating leverage will be offset by deterioration in mix (VIP grew a tad faster than mass/non-gaming). Among operators, we believe Galaxy’s EBITDA (flat qoq, or+6% qoq if adjusted for luck) can slightly beat the market’s expectations, while MPEL could disappoint a bit (+7% qoq, or flattish qoq if adj for luck). Other names will likely report in-line, in our view.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-tlie-ground findings from recent Macau trip. (1) Junket regulation: negative. </span><span class="font1">As announced last year (</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">link</span><span class="font1">), local government is working on new junket regulations to improve oversight, which could come out as early as this year. While the details are not finalized, tltis may include stricter rules on junkets’ funding source (esp. profit-sharing deposit scheme), which, if it happens, would impact the liquidity of smaller junkets. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(2) China’s policy stance: positive. </span><span class="font1">Most industry participants view the overall ‘tone’ from the Central government has become accommodative to the industry. This was evidenced by a series of visa news (e.g., transit visa relaxations in July and December, hukou-free IVS application in March, online IVS application for Beijing in April), and we think there could be more, such as improving business visa scheme and/or frequency of IVS. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(3) Mid-term review: neutral. </span><span class="font1">Most believe the government’s mid-term review will not be negative, though most do not seem to have expectations on what the report will detail regarding key issues such as license renewals.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On-the-ground findings. (4) Cost cutting: positive. </span><span class="font1">Room for further savings seems limited in the near-term, but new openings can drive another round of cost restructuring. We estimate most properties are carrying 20-25% of excess staff, and even newly opened properties can rationalize 5-10% of labor. The industry will be able to rationalize inefficient labor stiucture throughout 2H16-2017 into new openings. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(5) Opening schedule: neutral. </span><span class="font1">Wynn Palace seems ready for early Aug opening, and we think Sands’ Parisian can open by Nov/Dec. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(6) Change in disclosu re: neutral. </span><span class="font1">According to our checks, the level of disclosure by independent data providers could change, and detailed monthly revenue estimates (e.g., VIP/mass breakdown, market shares) could discontinue. This shouldn’t affect fundamentals, but could make the stocks volatile as it would be difficult to verify underlying performances until quarterly reporting. Government will continue to release ‘headline GGR’ every month, without details.</span></p>
