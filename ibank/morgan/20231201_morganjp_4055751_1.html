<p><span class="font5">With China resuming overseas tourism from early this year, Chinese visitors in Asia increased from 7% of 2019 levels in January to 40% in July (Figure 1). A modest setback followed in August-October, disappointing expectations for a boost from a week-long holiday in early October. This contrasts with the still-lasting recovery of non-Chinese tourist inflows, which began a year earlier. China’s tepid demand for overseas tourism may be attributed to softer-than-expected </span><span class="font5" style="text-decoration:underline;">domestic consumption</span><span class="font5"> this year, combined with the strong home bias of Chinese tourists: While China’s domestic air traffic has almost fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels, international traffic remains at just half (Figure 2). By destination, Chinese visited Thailand the most this year, followed by Japan and Korea, with their order of preference largely unchanged from 2019 (Figure 3). Japan and Korea recovered their share in 3Q23 after falling behind in 1H23, as they were included in China’s list of approved group tour destinations only in August, half a year later than ASEAN peers (Figure 4). Amid the delay in Chinese’s returns, Japan has been successfill in attracting tourists from other regions, showing a sharp increase in overall inflows in 3Q23 (Figures 5 and 6). Among non-Chinese visiting Asia so far tliis year, 23% chose Japan, 5%-pt higher than the country’s pre-pandemic share. JPY’s depreciation against most source markets’ currencies over the past year likely contributed to tliis gain.</span></p>
