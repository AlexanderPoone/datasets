<p><span class="font4">Export-oriented Turkish cyclicals demonstrated a strong share price performance YTD in tandem with strong domestic activity in Turkey that was largely triggered by credit support initiated by public banks in June. This helped to unlock the pent-up demand particularly in autos and household appliances, triggering robust domestic demand growth of 179% in autos and 33% in white goods in Q3. Recovery in the high margin domestic market was crucial for Ford, Tofas and Arcelik, helping all companies to surprise the market with strong profitability and stellar earnings momentum in Q3 while EPS tripled on y/y average. As Turkey is now entering a high rate environment, investors may have concerns over the sustainability of growth in cyclicals in 2021, which we would find unwarranted given that growth will likely shift to exports and Turkey is likely to enter a rate cut cycle after QI 21. On our conservative forecasts, we look for 24% revenue growth in Turkish cyclicals next year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font4">As the narratives are different for each company, we hereby summarize our view on each stock, highlighting our top two picks in the Turkish cyclical space as Arcelik and Ford Otosan, in that order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Arcelik- positive trends remain in place post COVID-19</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Appliance companies around the globe have all been giving the same key message: customers will continue to value their home environment highly, with the shift to online purchasing even for larger appliances likely to remain in place even after the pandemic. During the pandemic, e-commerce has doubled in Western Europe, and tripled in LaAam and EM. Arcelik has been a key beneficiary of customer behavioral change thanks to its higher share in online vs offline, particularly in its largest export market, UK where its online share increased from 20% of sales to 30%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the meantime, the industry faced many tailwinds during the pandemic, including supportive pricing, low raw material costs as well as strong replacement demand. Demand was exceptionally strong in Turkey, up 33% in white goods in Q3 and 87% in AC, supported by record high house sales and warm weather conditions. Going</span></p>
