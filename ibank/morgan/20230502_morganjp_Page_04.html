<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We have two scenarios that are based on the Strong Commitment to Orthodoxy. </span><span class="font4">In the Upside to the Bull case, we put the PE up to the 2nd quartile, the “Improvement” quartile, and we add another 10% to the earnings base. That generates upside from here of 108%. Below, we discuss the wide valuation gap of Turkiye in terms of stocks versus sectors; the market can double and would still have many stocks cheap to EM sector peers. That makes our upside to the Bull Case possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">We also have a Strong Commitment with Execution Risks scenario with a weaker TRY (26 v 24) and weaker earnings (unch, rather than +10%). </span><span class="font4">We would not be surprised if a sudden move up in rates generates slower than consensus earnings growth. However, we think most investors will (and should) look through near-term growth shortfalls as long as the long-term commitment to orthodoxy remains strong. If growth stumbles in ‘24, we think investors happy with macro policy will simply price stocks off an expected uptick in ‘25. Moreover, big policy shifts are never easy - we expect volatility and uncertainty along the way even if the outcome is the Upside to the Bull Case.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Analyzing the Modest Return to Orthodoxy</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Modest Return to Orthodoxy’ scenario sees a weaker TRY, USDTRY at year-end 30, rather than 25. </span><span class="font4">We also assume that a Modest Return to Orthodoxy implies no change in the PE and no upside from an equity re-rating. We pencil in the same 10% earnings growth as in the Strong Commitment scenario - but given the weaker TRY assumption this is lower earnings in USD terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Why low er TURKGB yields are bad for stocks. </span><span class="font4">The Modest Return scenario has 5-year TURKGB yields around 18% at end-year versus 20% in the Strong Commitment scenario, but we still have a lower PE multiple in the Modest Return scenario. In the Modest Return scenario, our FICC strategy team expects central banks to continue their policy of buying back bonds aggressively which keeps bonds expensive relative to stocks and other assets. Also, for investors looking for a more representative risk-free rate, our FICC strategy team expects off-shore oriented TRY yields (e.g cross-currency or CIS yields) to remain at a premium to onshore TURKGB yields.</span></p>
