<p><span class="font10">Biweekly Perspectives: Why It's Not The End of Growth Rotation</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Long duration assets were sold down globally amid the recent re-tightening of financial conditions. In Asia/EM, Low Quality Growth stocks Led the Losses, while Quality Growth continued to outperform. We believe it's not the end of Growth rotation, and the volatility is transitory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Latest market dynamics: </span><span class="font11">A series of hawkish messages from Fed officials have held back market risk sentiment in last week. The US treasury 10Y bond yield was up by +21bps and the US yield curve has inverted further. Investors were pricing toward a higher US terminal rate and a delayed rate cut; US dollar index rose by 2.4% from a recent low, while EM equities declined by 3.6% from a recent high. Outperformance of EM Growth stocks has taken a pause, and Defensive factors, Like &quot;Dividend&quot; and &quot;Earnings Stability&quot; stood out tactically.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Our analysis shows Low Quality High Beta stocks were particularly disfavored amid market declines of the last two weeks; the selloff of the segment has accelerated and led the losses among major styles. On the flipside, Quality Growth continued to outperform; stocks with consensus revisions Leadership added value. Fundamental factors have started to work, which are signs that Asia/EM has transited to the next phase of market cycle according to history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">Quant takeaways </span><span class="font11">We believe the recent pause of Growth vs. Value rotation was only tactical, and it's a natural result of higher volatility amid market cycle transition and recently re-tightened financial conditions. We note that the current scenario is different to what we experienced in the first three quarters last year, given current risk sentiment is much more solid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">From quant perspectives, our model did not recognize any outsized moves in derivatives markets - implied volatilities of US treasury bonds, EM equities, and EM FX all remained stable. In our model history, if there is no change of hedging behavior among investors, any style reversals and market volatility would tend to be short lived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11">Secondly, the bond futures market is already pricing in a US terminal rate at 5.12%, which means another 50bps rate hikes to come. Thus, the risk of our style call - to favor Growth over Value - is the rate hike expectation to go beyond 50bps, which is unlikely per our US economists' latest opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font11" style="font-weight:bold;">We believe that market transition to mid-cycle is almost finished, </span><span class="font11">and the recent volatility is transitory. Our suggested quant strategies over next two weeks are to (i) add Quality Growth amid any price weaknesses, (ii) keep avoiding high beta stocks, (iii) Look for sector-neutral alpha via consensus revisions leadership, and (iv) pay attention to any spikes of implied volatility post the release of US January inflation due this Tuesday.</span></p>
