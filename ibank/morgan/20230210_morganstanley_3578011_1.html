<p><span class="font6">Seeker Says - The safety cushion is deflating</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font2"># 1 Changing policy conditions suggest more volatility ahead;</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font2"># 2 Recovery in valuation and sentiment suggests deteriorating risk-reward; #3 Europe's strong start to the year likely requires EPS upgrades ahead; #4 Cyclical rally at odds with yield curve; #5 SMID stocks Look attractive, especially MDAX.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"># 1- Policy conditions have been biggest driver of this rally. </span><span class="font7">While the macro data has come through better than expected the biggest drivers of the equity rally to date have been USD weakness, Lower rate expectations and falling bond yields. Post recent developments in the US we now assume two more Fed rate hikes and have turned neutral on the USD (from negative) and USTs (from positive). This change in the policy dynamic suggests more equity volatility ahead.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"># 2 - Safety cushion is deflating. </span><span class="font7">The safety cushion that investors have enjoyed from lower valuation and depressed sentiment has deflated considerably. Europe's median stock now trades on a N12M PE of 15.9 (Long-run average is 142) our GRDI index is close to a 10Y high and AAII net bulls has turned positive after a record run in negative territory. In addition, over the last week our cross-asset strategist's US cycle indicator has moved into downturn and their more tactical market sentiment indicator has turned negative.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"># 3 - European equity performance implies a return to positive earnings revisions. </span><span class="font7">Over the last year equity markets have Led earnings revisions by 20 days. Hence MSCI Europe's strong start to the year implies a healthy rise in earnings revisions ahead. While a benign 4Q results season helps we see little scope for a return to a new upgrade cycle. Any further deterioration in revisions would be a clear warning sign for stocks.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"># 4 - Cyclicals' strong outperformance may not signal the all clear this time.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font7">European cyclicals have beaten defensives by 18% over the last Gm. Historically, such strong performance signals the start of a new cycle and further cyclical outperformance ahead. However, we see three reasons why it will be different this time: 0 cyclicals' ROE is not depressed; ii) an inverted yield curve is usually followed by cyclical underperformance; iii) cyclicals are trading on a similar PBV to defensives, previously this has often marked a sell signal for the group.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;"># 5- SMID offersa much better risk-re ward profile here. </span><span class="font7">Investors who wish to implement a more positive view on the macro backdrop should favour Small &amp;&nbsp;Mid caps (SMID) here instead of cyclicals. Unlike cyclicals, SMID stocks are not overbought and valuations are at the bottom of the historical range. Our EURUSD target of 1.15 would be consistent with &gt;10% SMID outperformance this year. MDAX remains 19% below its peak (DAX just 5% off its high) and trades 15% below its average relative PE level.</span></p></li></ul>
