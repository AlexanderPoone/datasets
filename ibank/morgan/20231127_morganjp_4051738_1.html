<p><span class="font7">Japanese stocks have rallied in tandem with U.S. and European markets amid November’s rapid decline in U.S. interest rates and rise in the yen. Semiconductor names such as Tokyo Electron and tech stocks such as Recruit came back to life, and machinery stocks such as Keyence also pushed TOPIX higher. We view all of this as an initial reaction of risk assets to lower U.S. interest rates. As the market focus sliifts to the slowdown in the U.S. economy, we believe Japan’s structural changes will support Japanese equities. In tliis report, we summarize how these recent major macroeconomic changes (lower US interest rates, stronger yen) are impacting Japanese equities and what it implies for equity investment strategy, based on feedback from our meetings with North America investors the week of Nov 13-17.</span></p>

Data through November 10 show weekly buying inflows from overseas investors reaching the¥l trillion level for the first time in 10 weeks (Figure I). These stock price gains are coming mainly on higher multiples amid rising expectations of a halt to Fed rate hikes, and we see this as an initial reaction to lower U.S. interest rates. As the market focus sliifts to a U.S. economic slowdown, webelieve that structural changes unique to Japan —deflation exit, capex recovery, corporate balance-sheet improvement, capital flows—will support Japanese equities going forward and have them outperforming stock markets overseas.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will the reversal in growth stocks continue?: The recent turnaround in Japanese growth stocks has been driven by (I) an upward adjustment of low valuations, (2) a slight bottoming out of earnings at semiconductor and early-cycle machinery stocks, and (3) a decline in U.S. long-term interest rates, which weighed on financial stocks, and a rise in the yen, which weighed on automotive names and other external-demand value stocks. The latter two factors were accompanied by a change in fundamentals, with the decline in U.S. interest rates slightly reducing the comparative advantage of value stocks and fueling a Runaround for growth (Figure 3). However, we see value stocks remaining strong for the time being, as the bottom in semiconductor and machinery earnings seen in Jul-Sep was only L-shaped (i.e., a full-fledged recovery still awaits), wages and interest rates in Japan are expected to rise, the yen’s appreciation against the dollar is moderate, and corporate balance-sheet reforms continue. We accordingly expect value to maintain an advantage for</span></p></li></ul>
