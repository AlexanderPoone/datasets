<p><span class="font5">A steady trend of mostly better than expected economic data as well as the debt ceiling resolution have kept Treasuries under pressure, led to an S&amp;P 500 Index breakout from the multi-month trading range, and put our medium-term outlooks under considerable pressure. Time will tell whether the recent price action is a false hope late in an economic cycle or a more lasting dynamic that completely upends our favored outlooks into the second half of the year. For now, we need to respect the US front end’s late-May release through Mar-May range support and more recent rejection of that area as new resistance. Furthermore, the US equity market saw a transition in leadership as the S&amp;P 5 00 Index pushed through the 4200 area with cyclically sensitive sectors driving the charge, and industrial metals as well as correlated FX pairs staged short-term bullish trend reversals. While we think these moves will likely whipsaw, we can’t have high conviction until we see high frequency price action that points in that direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The post-payrolls </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">2-year note </span><span class="font5">backup paused the rebound from the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.655% </span><span class="font5">May 26 yield high and importantly kept the market from retaking a key chart area. The </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.26-4.30% </span><span class="font5">yield highs defined the cheap end of the Mar-May trading range prior to the recent breakdown (Figure 1). Furthermore, the 50-day, 100-day, and 200-day moving averages are all clustered at </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.09-4.25%. </span><span class="font5">The late-May break and this week’s rejection of that key area puts a material dent in our outlook, which had favored a release to lower yields into the summer. For now, we are left watching for a yield top pattern to form near support that includes the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.59% </span><span class="font5">Mar 13 bull gap and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.76% </span><span class="font5">Mar 78.6% retrace. Despite the near-term setback, the 4Q22/1H23 price action can still prove to be a bullish reversal pattern if that short-term pattern develops in the days weeks ahead. A sustaiend move through 4.25% would start to put our view back on solid ground again, and bulls would gain further traction with a break through the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">4.07% </span><span class="font5">May 10 yield high. Medium-term pattern resistance rmains at the 3.55-3.655%Mar-May yield lows.</span></p>
