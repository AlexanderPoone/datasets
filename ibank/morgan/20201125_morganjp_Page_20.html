<p><span class="font3">into 2021, we keep our positive stance, seeing low inventory levels in Turkish dealers as positive for manufacturers to keep their sell-in revenues strong in QI and potential rate cuts after QI to help the overall domestic demand. In Europe, replacement demand is likely to slow down but supportive pricing will continue to help companies who have stronger position in digitalization, including Arcelik. In Asean and SA markets, we expect growth to accelerate with opening up of economies, helping Arcelik to improve its profitability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, the company is also well positioned against rising interest rates in Turkey with exceptionally well managed working capital as well as its refinancing timetable that coincides with a potential rate cut cycle in Q2. The company will refinance the bulk of its loans, c.45% in Q2 21 which has an interest cost of20-25%; higher than the post rate hike interest cost in Turkey, providing room to cut its financing costs further in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ford Otosan - growth shifting to exports, further value depends on capex cycle </span><span class="font3">As Ford’s largest commercial vehicle manufacturer in Europe, Otosan is the best proxy to play the upcoming cyclical recovery in key European markets, in our view. The company generates 85% of its revenues from exports, with Germany and the UK making up 40% of the export volume. The European van market (vans &lt;3.5 tons) turned positive by September, demonstrating 18% growth on average and above average growth of 26% in the UK and 20% in Germany. Yet, on a YTD basis, European demand in key export markets is still down 24%, providing substantial room for recovery in 2021.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Positive structural currents include the growing online business that boosts demand for Otosan’s Transit and Transit Custom models both in Turkey and Europe. This has been a long-awaited story that has started to crystalize and should help Ford Otosan to continue to differentiate itself from its peers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Meanwhile, the company is on the verge of growing its business, as it is a key beneficiary of the global collaboration between Ford Motor and VW. Starting from end-2022, we expect Otosan to produce the Transporter series of VW along with increasing capacity in the Custom series. Although details have not been confirmed yet, the current demand outlook for these products requires a potential capacity increase of at least 150k units on top of Otosan’s current capacity of455k units. Our sensitivity analysis suggest that each 100k unit of additional production would deliver 28% higher EBIT in 2023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Finally, of note are dividends with an expected 6.8% yield in 2021, which will make the stock attractive for dividend funds. We expect management to follow its maximum dividend policy off the back of strong profitability, robust cash generation and a postponed second tranche of dividends in 2020 after temporary limitations put in place by the government. Further, cash flow analysis suggests that although it will start a heavy capex period by 2H21, the company has a strong balance sheet to finance this without distorting its dividend policy.</span></p>
