<p><a name="bookmark2"></a><span class="font4"><a name="bookmark3"></a>Bullish on Regional Banks with the Fed Moving Slow and Steady the Key; Upgrade CMA, Downgrade BKU</span></p>
<p><span class="font6">With persistent (and rising) inflation resulting in a ramp in short-term rates, the talk of the town has pivoted towards increased likelihood that the yield curve inverts in the quarters ahead, which has historically been a fairly good predictor of an upcoming recession. While we have all been schooled time and time again that it’s a mistake to assume that “it will be different this time,” at the moment the trouble that we are having with historical precedents is that we continue to struggle to find any period of time (ever) that looked like the myriad of oddities facing investors today. As a result, given a multitude of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">cross-currents</span><span class="font6"> dotting the landscape, our base case is that (1) the Fed moves at a slow and steady pace with rate hikes as well as reducing its balance sheet and that (2) the US economy proves to be resilient enough to (at least over the short-run) to avoid a deep recession. To this end, given surging costs for food and energy, we would not be surprised if this results in a partial reversal of the “great resignation” over the near-tenn (further supporting the labor market). Not to mention that even as discretional spending contracts in the months ahead, it’s more likely in our view that employers reduce the number of job openings rather than reducing actual filled positions given the </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">significant</span><span class="font6"> challenge companies have experienced to find workers (with 1.8 job openings today for every person now looking fora job). Along these lines, although the macro environment remains fluid, at this juncture we see a very attractive risk/reward among regional banks. In fact with stocks in our coverage universe trading at nearly </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">half the multiple of the S&amp;P 500</span><span class="font6"> but expected to drive bottom line growth through 2023 that is </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">more than double that of the broader markets, </span><span class="font6">bank stocks are poised to outperfonn (and are, we believe, </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font6"> key beneficiary of a growth to value rotation). As a result, we remain bullish on bank stocks but encourage investors to concentrate positions on the best positioned banks for top line growth coming from a variety of sources. With that said, with rising rates a key catalyst, we favor asset sensitivity and, as a result, are upgrading CMA (to OW) and downgrade BKU (to Neutral). Top 6 picks FRC, SIVB, SBNY, PNFP, SNV, &amp;&nbsp;CMA.</span></p>

<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deposit Rates Fairly Well Anchored after the First Rate Hike. </span><span class="font6">Following the Fed’s rate hike in March, we looked at -60 banks across the US and found that only 5 banks—Frost, Live Oak Bank, Citi, PNC, and Regions—raised deposit rates marginally on a few deposit products (by an average of ~10 bps). Looking ahead, we expect most US banks to hold deposit rates fairly steady over the near-tenn.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Key 1Q22 trends: (</span><span class="font6">1) NIM expansion of 2 bps q/q; (2) Average loans to increase at a 7.0% ann. pace and average deposits to increase at a 4.8% ann. pace; (3) Expenses to increase at a 12.0% ann. pace; (4) We expect reserve ratios to remain steady q/q while NCOs to rise slightly q/q but remain low and NPAs decrease slightly q/q.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swapping Out of BKU and Into CMA. </span><span class="font6">With CMA having strong earnings leverage tied to rising short-term rates, we see 2022/2023 revenue growth potential as among the highest within regional banks. On the flipside, while we like that BKU is planting the seeds for sustained long-term growth with new initiatives, we expect top line growth to trail peers in 2022/23 due to in part to lower asset sensitivity.</span></p></li>
<li>
<p><span class="font7" style="font-weight:bold;">• &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sector Positioning: Barbell approach—Diversify across Niche Growth Banks and Asset Sensitive Regional Banks. </span><span class="font6">While our niche growth banks—FRC, SIVB, SBNY, SI, LOB, MCB—are all on sale now (-23% vs. 52-week highs), layering in asset sensitivity, our top 6 picks are: FRC, SIVB, SBNY, PNFP, SNV and CMA.</span></p></li></ul>
