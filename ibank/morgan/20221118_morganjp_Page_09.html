<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The US HY bond universe has contracted by $156bn or 10%+ year-to-date to $1.37trn, </span><span class="font5">with $100bn of that contraction occurring due to the imbalance of Rising Stars and Fallen Angels. For context, the previous largest contraction for the HY universe occurred in 2018/19 at $65bn per annum. These conditions are proving influential in the absence of extreme market stress or new issue. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In that vein, our sector analysts updated their projections for Rising Stars </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">here</span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;"> and have identified 29 issuers with $160bn of debt likely to be upgraded from HY to HG through 2023 with the 3 largest issuers accounting for 54%. </span><span class="font5">A list of companies that comprise our rising star forecast along with a brief rationale for the ratings views is included. The analysts are noted in the table, and they welcome further discussion on these credits. This is matched against a forecast for only $15bn of Fallen Angels in 2023. At the industry level the largest drivers of our Rising Star forecast are in Energy ($59bn), Autos ($49bn) and Cable/Satellite ($17bn) while Fallen Angels may come from Healthcare and Autos through 2024. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Based on a projection for a $145bn imbalance between RS/FAs through YE23, coupled with a constrained new-issue backdrop for 2023, we estimate that the HY universe w ill contract by another ~9-10% over the next 14 months (~$120-$140bn).</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Based on the list of rising star candidates, w hat is the impact on yields and spreads and how could the composition of the developed HY universe change? If we remove the list of rising star candidates, the yield and spread for the unconstrained developed HY would increase by 29bp apiece. </span><span class="font5">This equates to roughly a 6% increase in spread terms. Notably as well, the BB yield and spread of the index would rise by 15bp apiece (or 5% in spread terms). </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Focusing next on industries, the weight of the Energy sector would fall by 295bp from 13.4% of the HY universe to 10.4%. </span><span class="font5">Meanwhile, the Auto and Utility sector weightings would fall by 251bp and 63bp, respectively, to a mere 3.2% and 2.2% of the index. Notably, the Energy sector would still be the largest sector in the HY index by an order of 152bp versus Gaming/Leisure/Ledging and 170bp versus Healthcare. Transitioning to ratings, what would be the impact on the BB universe, which currently resides at 50.1 % of an unconstrained H Y index? Of course, the BB portion of the HY index surged to a record high in 2020 amid a combination of fallen angels and wave of defaults (i.e., collapse in CCCs). </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Notably, the $708bn universe of BB bonds would contract by 25% to $531bn and represent 43.9% (-6.2%) of an unconstrained developed HY index by the end of 2024. </span><span class="font5">The rebalance would also lift CCCs from a more than 20yr low 11.2% of the HY index to 12.6% (excluding</span></p>
