<p><span class="font3">Figure 1 does show that at the same time US tech companies declined significantly. This is a result of multiple derating due to increased interest rates. We forecasted this process and multiple de-rating over a year ago </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">(here)</span><span class="font3">, which was the basis for our call that value will significantly outperform growth. This relative convergence of value and growth has likely run its course. However, that does not mean that a recession is priced in (contraction of corporate earnings), but rather that higher rates caused multiple de-rating of long duration stocks. Clearly, looking at the performance of Europe, Industrials and Dow Jones, which are basically unchanged over the past year despite all of the negative macro shocks, indicate a recession is not priced in. This is part of the reason we recently tactically downgraded energy </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">(here)</span><span class="font3"> as cyclicals and value would take a hit with the onset of a recession and decline in interest rates. Finally, we want to reiterate what has changed since mid-last year when we thought that a recession is priced in. Simply, at that point in time, recession-sensitive markets were almost 20% lower than now, earnings expectations were higher, and terminal Fed Funds were much lower than where they are projected to peak now.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">With the potential for equities and bond yields to drop, there is an important question of what is the right allocation, and how re-allocations may further impact equity and bond markets. Here we focus on defined benefit pension funds, their funding status and potential flows that would ensure they remain funded. Total pension assets in the 22 largest pension markets are ~$57Tr (~$52Tr of which is in the 7 largest countries (P7) at the end of 2021), according to the Thinking Ahead Institute. About 54% of pension assets are in defined contribution, and 46% in defined benefit plans (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">here)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font3">The average equity allocation is 45% in P7 countries. For better part of last 20 years, defined benefit plans had a chronic underfunding problem (Figure 2). This was largely a result of low bond yields that are used to discount future liabilities. However, with the increase of interest rates, this has quickly changed and these plans are now overfunded (110%), overall, for the first time in nearly two decades. This problem quickly disappeared, but it can relatively quickly come back and again persist for decades if equities and bond yields drop (which typically happens in and after recessions). This represents a unique and urgent opportunity for these funds to lock in the favorable funding status by selling equities and buying bonds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">What could the flows be from these rebalances? In a slow-moving market and when the funding moves are not extreme, these reallocations would typically be -1-2% of assets per year per year (e.g. ~$500bn). However, given the large overfunding and market developments that can cause this window to close soon, we would expect (and it would be prudent) to see an increase in the reallocation. Based on the size of defined benefit assets, if the reallocation increases to 3-4% of assets, this could translate to ~$1T of equity selling over a year and is a flow that is bigger than the potential combined systematic inflows on account of low volatility. If this reallocation pace is higher, e.g. 6%, these flows would dominate the performance of stocks and likely cause significant drawdowns this year. Historically, following periods of overfunding, equities underperformed and bonds outperformed, indicating that overfunded status is a likely inflection point for equities to go lower and bonds higher, and that these flows perhaps have market impact as well. Figure 3 shows that following instances with overfunded status, bonds outperform equities by a wide margin. In particular, 3, 6, and 9 months after an ‘overfunded’ signal, bonds outperform stocks by 7%, 15%, and 24% (hit rate of 73%, 85%, and 94%), respectively. We do</span></p>
