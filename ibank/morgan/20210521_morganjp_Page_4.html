<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Second, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">recent guidance</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3">from the OCC authorizes domestic banks under their supervision to accept deposits from stablecoin issuers only if those tokens are fully resented (among other requirements), which Tether has admitted to misrepresenting and violating in their </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">recent settlement</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font3">with the NYAG Office. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Finally, </span><span class="font3">these admissions as well as other concerns will likely raise reputational risk concerns among larger domestic banks that can accommodate a material fraction of those reserve assets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Tether may have limited direct access to the U.S. banking system, but its competitors are likely less constrained. </span><span class="font3">That means potential CP demand from this segment is likely dependent to some extent on their continued dominance of the ecosystem. Here the trend is somewhat less favorable, with USDT share by both market capitalization and trading activity declining slowly but steadily over the past year or so—though it remains dominant by both measures </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(Exhibit 4). </span><span class="font3">To the extent competitors with more stringent transparency and disclosure can and choose to source bank deposits it will likely weaken commercial paper demand from this segment, all else equal. That said, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it is worth noting that all major asset-backed stablecoin issuers have quite a bit of flexibility in how they deploy reserve funds. </span><span class="font3">The U.S. banking system is also generally incentivized to reduce their deposit inflows, particularly non-operational accounts of the kind held by stablecoin reserve managers (see e.g., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">Deposita non-grata,</span><span class="font3"> T. Ho et al., 3/25/21). Though their ability to refuse deposits is likely somewhat limited in general (see </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">Interest Rate Derivatives,</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">US Fixed Income Markets Weekly,</span><span class="font3"> 3/19/21, cryptocurrency-related holdings are likely easier to turn away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This may seem an extended discussion for what essentially amounts to a modest segment of the commercial paper market. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">It is worth bearing in mind, however, that this market has the potential to grow significantly. </span><span class="font3">Importantly, that growth is not necessarily that strongly coupled to further appreciation and increased turnover in Bitcoin, Ether, and other free-floating ciyptocurrencies. Facebook, for example, has continued its work on stablecoins, selecting Silvergate Bank<sup>1</sup> as issuer and reserve manager for USD-backed Diem (the successor to Libra) with a goal of minting the first tokens as part of a </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">pilot project</span><span class="font3"> later this year. Though the </span><span class="font3" style="text-decoration:underline;">whitepaper</span><span class="font3"> released earlier this year does not provide many details on the reserves fund assets, they do list cash and equivalents, the accounting definition of which includes securities maturing within 90 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">One final wildcard is potential changes in the regulatory treatment of stablecoins and their reserve funds. Though the OCC interpretive letter is the best current guidance that is subject to change, potentially on short notice as key staff continue to turn over. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">There is also the risk that as stablecoins become more systemically important their reserve funds could be designated as financial market infrastructure, giving reserve managers direct access to Federal Reserve liabilities. </span><span class="font3">This would, in effect, drain reserves from the system, which at this point is arguably desirable given continued pressures on short-term funding markets amidst ongoing monetaiy stimulus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> Based on </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">10 2021 Call Reports,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">Silvergate Bank has roughly $9bn in assets of which $4.3bn are reserves held at the Fed funded almost entirely by non-interest bearing deposits.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a>
