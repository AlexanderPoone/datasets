<p><span class="font3">P/E was estimated at c43x 2014 historical P/E. This is admittedly high but profit growth in 2015 - while noting we don’t have final full year financials for the port - should have brought this figure down. The deal has since been completed and this brownfield project has started making contributions since the beginning of this year.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style:none;"><li>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purchase of 35% stake in Euromax port in Rotterdam, Netherlands (announced in May'16 and targeting completion in 2H16) - </span><span class="font3">CP recently announced that it would be acquiring a stake in Euromax Port from HPH for a total consideration of EUR125.43MM (US$143MM) which includes cUS96MM to be paid for a 35% shareholder’s loan. Valuation was once again a key concern as the implied historical P/E was 42.9x based on the share sale consideration. That said, CP expects Euromax to be able to sen-e as a hub port location for the new OCEAN alliance which could result in more volume security while the port is still young (operations only began in mid-2010 and only turned profitable in 2014) which could skew the P/E upwards since the profit level is still low.</span></p></li></ul>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">During the FY15 results briefing, CP’s management indicated that they had 7 projects on hand along the Maritime Silk Road that would be executable in the near term </span><span class="font3">(6 left if we exclude the already announced Rotterdam acquisition - see below for map of locations) and another two potential assets in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. As a result, we believe the company could announce additional deals in the coming two years as CP jostles for positioning along the Maritime Silk Road (we note that other operators, including CMHI, are employing similar strategies and are thus also actively engaged in looking at overseas assets). Hence, we believe additional announcements of earnings/value accretive deals could support the share price higher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Taking a look at CP’s 1Q16 balance sheet, we estimate that the company has another US$1.IB of capital capacity for deployment in the near term </span><span class="font3">(closer to USS IB if we include the announced Rotterdam acquisition) suggesting we could see more acquisition announcements in the coming quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">We believe CP’s overseas execution track record, overseas presence, as well as close relationship with the COSCO shipping operations will give CP an advantage when looking to secure additional overseas deals.</span></p>
<p><a name="bookmark0"></a><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><a name="bookmark1"></a>Expecting more cooperation between CP and CMHI for future acquisitions? Potential win-win situation for China's two largest port operators</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The partnership between CMHI and CP on the Kumport deal is intriguing given the two companies are often looked at as being rival operators. However, we do note that the two have actually worked together in the past with overlapping minority stakes in Taiwan and T ianjin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But last year’s Kumport deal was the first time the two joined forces to purchase a controlling stake. </span><span class="font3">Both companies cited that they had identified Kumport as a potential acquisition target on their own and ultimately decided to form a partnership in order to avoid a bidding war which would have pushed the purchase</span></p>
